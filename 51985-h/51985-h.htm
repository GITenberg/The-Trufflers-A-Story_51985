      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE GIRL IN THE PLAID COAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER ERICSON MANN
      leaned back in his chair and let his hands fall listlessly from the
      typewriter to his lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised them again and laboriously pecked out a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, walked to one of the front windows of the dingy old studio and
      peered gloomily out at the bare trees and brown grass patches of
      Washington Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was a playwright of three early (and partial) successes, and two
      more recent failures. He was thirty-three years old; and a typical New
      Yorker, born in Iowa, he dressed conspicuously, well, making it a
      principle when in funds to stock up against lean seasons to come. He
      worried a good deal and kept his savings of nearly six thousand dollars
      (to the existence of which sum he never by any chance alluded) in five
      different savings banks. He wore large horn-rimmed eyeglasses (not
      spectacles) with a heavy black ribbon attached, and took his Art almost as
      seriously as himself. You know him publicly as Eric Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six months Peter had been writing words where ideas were imperatively
      demanded. Lately he had torn up the last of these words. He had waited in
      vain for the divine uprush; there had come no tingle of delighted nerves,
      no humming vitality, no punch. And as for his big scene, in Act III, it
      was a morass of sodden, tangled, dramatic concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      His theme this year was the modern bachelor girl; but to save his life he
      couldn't present her convincingly as a character in a play&mdash;perhaps
      because these advanced, outspoken young women irritated him too deeply to
      permit of close observation. Really, they frightened him. He believed in
      marriage, the old-fashioned woman, the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had reached the point, a month back, where he could no longer even
      react to stimulants. He had revived an old affair with a pretty manicure
      girl without stirring so much as a flutter of excitement within himself.
      This was Maria Tonifetti, of the sanitary barber shop of Marius in the
      basement of the Parisian Restaurant. He had tried getting drunk; which
      made him ill and induced new depths of melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one ever saw his name any more. No one, he felt certain, ever would see
      it. He could look back now on the few years of his success in a spirit of
      awful calm. He felt that he had had genius. But the genius had burned out.
      All that remained to him was to live for a year or two (or three) watching
      that total of nearly six thousand dollars shrink&mdash;-shrink&mdash;-and
      then the end of everything. Well, he would not be the first....
    </p>
    <p>
      One faint faded joy had lately been left to Peter, one sorry reminder of
      the days when the magical words, the strangely hypnotic words, &ldquo;Eric
      Mann,&rdquo; had spoken, sung, shouted from half the bill-boards in town. Over
      beyond Sixth Avenue, hardly five minutes' walk through the odd tangle of
      wandering streets, the tenements and ancient landmarks and subway
      excavations and little triangular breathing places that make up the
      Greenwich Village of to-day, there had lingered one faded, torn
      twenty-four-sheet poster, advertising &ldquo;The Buzzard, by Eric Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was bluest lately, Peter had occasionally walked over there and
      stood for a while gazing at this lingering vestige of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went over there now, in soft hat and light overcoat, and carrying his
      heavy cane&mdash;hurried over there, in fact&mdash;across the Square and
      on under the Sixth Avenue elevated into that quaint section of the great
      city which socialists, anarchists, feminists, Freudian psycho-analysts of
      self, magazine writers, Jewish intellectuals, sculptors and painters of
      all nationalities and grades, sex hygiene enthusiasts, theatrical
      press-agents and various sorts of youthful experimenters in living share
      with the merely poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at a familiar spot on the curb by a familiar battered lamp-post
      and peered across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he started&mdash;and stared. Surprise ran into bewilderment,
      bewilderment into utter dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faded, torn twenty-four-sheet poster had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new brand of cut plug tobacco was advertised there now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ragged children of the merely poor, cluttering pavement and sidewalk, fell
      against him in their play. Irritably he brushed them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman was crossing the street toward him, nimbly dodging behind a
      push cart and in front of a coal truck. Deep in self, he lowered his gaze
      and watched her. So intent was his stare that the girl stopped short, one
      foot on the curb, slowly lowered the apple she was eating, and looked
      straight at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shaped like a boy, he decided&mdash;good shoulders, no hips, fine
      hands (she wore no gloves, though the March air was crisp) and trim feet
      in small, fiat-heeled tan boots. Her hair, he thought, was cut short. He
      was not certain, for her &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; tarn o'shanter covered it and hung low
      on her neck behind. He moved a step to one side and looked more closely.
      Yes, it was short. Not docked, in the current fashion, but cut close to
      her head, like a boy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped up on the curb now and confronted him. He noted that her suit
      was of brown stuff, loosely and comfortably cut; and that the boyish outer
      coat, which she wore swinging open, was of a rough plaid. Then he became
      aware of her eyes. They were deep green and vivid. Her skin was a clear
      olive, prettily tinted by air and exercise... Peter suddenly knew that he
      was turning red.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't we better say something?&rdquo; was her remark. Then she took another
      bite of the apple, and munched it with honest relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely we would better,&rdquo; he managed to reply&mdash;rather severely,
      for the &ldquo;had better&rdquo; phrase always annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if I must have met you somewhere,&rdquo; he ventured next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we haven't met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then suppose you tell me yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter could not think of a reason why. Deeply as he was supposed to
      understand women, here was a new variety. She was inclined neither to
      flirt nor to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that you know who I am?&rdquo; he asked, sparring for time..
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a careless shrug. &ldquo;Oh, most every one is known, here in the
      Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was always at his best when recognized as <i>the</i> Eric Mann. His
      spirits rose a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I suggest that we have a cup of tea somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knit her brows. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied slowly, even doubtfully, &ldquo;you
      might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim's isn't far. Let's go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim's was an oyster and chop emporium of ancient fame in the Village. They
      sat at a rear table. The place was empty save for an old waiter who
      shuffled through the sprinkling of sawdust on the floor, and a fat
      grandson of the original Jim who stood by the open grill that was set in
      the wall at the rear end of the oyster bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the tea Peter said, expanding now&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps this is reason
      enough for you to tell me who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps what is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smilingly passed the toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a slice, and considered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if I am not to know, how on earth am I to manage
      seeing you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly inclined her head. &ldquo;That's just it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Peter's turn to knit his brow's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I be sure that I want you to see me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved an exasperated hand. &ldquo;Then why are we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At least he could smoke. He opened his cigarette case. Then, though he
      never felt right about women smoking, he extended it toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said she, taking one and casually lighting it. Yes, she <i>had</i>
      fine hands. And he had noted when she took off her coat and reached up to
      hang it on the wall rack, her youth-like suppleness of body. A provocative
      person!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen some of your plays,&rdquo; she observed, elbows on table, chin on
      hand, gazing at the smoke-wraiths of her cigarette. &ldquo;Two or three. <i>Odd
      Change</i> and <i>Anchored</i> and&mdash;what was it called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The Buzzard?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>The Buzzard</i>. They were dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color slowly left Peter's face. The girl was speaking without the
      slightest self-consciousness or wish to offend. She meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter managed to recover some part of his poise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said. Then: &ldquo;If they were all dreadful, why didn't you stop
      after the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&mdash;she waved her cigarette&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Odd Change</i> came to town
      when I was in college, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're a college girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a crowd of us went. That one wasn't so bad as the others. You
      know your tricks well enough&mdash;especially in comedy, carpentered
      comedy. Theatrically, I suppose you're really pretty good or your things
      wouldn't succeed. It is when you try to deal with life&mdash;and with
      women&mdash;that you're....&rdquo; Words failed her. She smoked in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm what?&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;The limit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, very thoughtful. &ldquo;Since you've said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he cried, aiming at a gay humor and missing heavily&mdash;&ldquo;but
      now, having slapped me in the face and thrown me out in the snow, don't
      you think that you'd better&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated, watching for a smile
      that failed to make its appearance. &ldquo;That I'd better what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;tell me a little more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering if I could. The difficulty is, it's the whole thing&mdash;your
      attitude toward life&mdash;the perfectly conventional, perfectly
      unimaginative home and mother stuff, your hopeless sentimentality about
      women, the slushy, horrible, immoral Broadway falseness that lies back of
      everything you do&mdash;the Broadway thing, always. Ever, in your comedy,
      good as that sometimes is. Your insight into life is just about that of a
      hardened director of one-reel films. What I've been wondering since we met
      this afternoon&mdash;you see, I didn't know that we were going to meet in
      this way...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... is whether it would be any use to try and help you. You have ability
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let's trifle! You see, if it is any use at all to try to get a
      little&mdash;just a little&mdash;truth into the American theater, why,
      those of us that believe in truth owe it to our faith to get to work on
      the men that supply the plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless.&rdquo; Peter's mind was racing in a dozen directions at once. This
      extraordinary young person had hit close; that much he knew. He wondered
      rather helplessly whether the shattered and scattered remnants of his
      self-esteem could ever be put together again so the cracks wouldn't show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confusing thing was that he couldn't, at the moment, feel angry toward
      the girl; she was too odd and too pretty. Already he was conscious of a
      considerable emotional stir, caused by her mere presence there across the
      table. She reached out now for another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he gloomily, &ldquo;that you'd better tell me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I'll tell you how you can find me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have to take a little trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the Crossroads Theater to-night, in Tenth Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;-that little place of Zanin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;That little place of Zanin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you haven't. None of the people that might be helped by it ever
      come. You see, we aren't professional, artificialized actors. We are just
      trying to deal naturally with bits of real life&mdash;from the Russian,
      and things that are written here in the Village. Jacob Zanin is a big man&mdash;a
      fine natural man&mdash;with a touch of genius, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was silent. He knew this brilliant, hulking Russian Jew, and
      disliked him: even feared him in a way, as he feared others of his race
      with what he felt to be their hard clear minds, their vehement idealism,
      their insistent pushing upward. The play that had triumphantly displaced
      his last failure at the Astoria Theater was written by a Russian Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      She added: &ldquo;In some ways it is the only interesting theater in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is so much to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;And we don't play every night, of course. Only
      Friday and Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was regarding her now with kindling interest. &ldquo;What do you do there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing much. I'm playing a boy this month in Zanin's one-act piece,
      <i>Any Street</i>. And sometimes I dance. I was on my way there when I met
      you&mdash;was due at three o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a rehearsal, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't make it. It's four-fifteen now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're playing a boy,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I wonder if that is why you cut off
      your hair.&rdquo; He felt brutally daring in saying this. He had never been
      direct with women or with direct women. But this girl created her own
      atmosphere which quite enveloped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she simply, &ldquo;I had to for the part.&rdquo; Never would he have
      believed that the attractive woman lived who would do that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly, as if acting on an impulse, she pushed back her chair. &ldquo;I'm
      going,&rdquo; she remarked; adding; &ldquo;You'll find you have friends who know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was getting into her coat now. He hurried awkwardly around the table,
      and helped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he, suddenly all questions, now that he was losing her&mdash;&ldquo;You
      live here in the Village, I take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nearly smiled. &ldquo;No, with another girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pursed her lips. &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo; A moment more of hesitation, then: &ldquo;Her
      name is Deane, Betty Deane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard that name. Yes, I've seen her&mdash;at the Black and White
      ball this winter! A blonde&mdash;pretty&mdash;went as a Picabia dancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were mounting the steps to the sidewalk (for Jim's is a basement).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Will you come&mdash;to-night or to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;To-night.&rdquo; And walked in a daze back to the rooms on
      Washington Square.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;THE SEVENTH-STORY MEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT until he was
      crossing Sixth Avenue, under the elevated road, did it occur to him that
      she had deliberately broken her rehearsal appointment to have tea with him
      and then as deliberately, had left him for the rehearsal. He had
      interested her; then, all at once, he had ceased to interest her. It was
      not the first time Peter had had this experience with women, though none
      of the others had been so frank about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, she certainly was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Resentments rose. Why on earth had he sat there so meekly and let her go
      on like that&mdash;he, the more or less well-known Eric Mann! Had he no
      force of character at all? No dignity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose she had to write plays to suit the whims of penny-splitting
      Broadway managers who had never heard of Andreyev and Tchekov, were bored
      by Shaw and Shakespeare and thought an optimist was an eye doctor&mdash;where
      would <i>she</i> get off!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short block between Sixth Avenue and the Square, anger
      conquered depression. When he entered the old brick apartment building he
      was muttering. When he left the elevator and walked along the dark
      corridor to the rooms he was considering reprisals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shared the dim old seventh-floor apartment with two fellow
      bachelors, Henry Sidenham Lowe and the Worm. The three were sometimes
      known as the Seventh-Story Men. The phrase was Hy Lowe's and referred to
      the newspaper stories of that absurd kidnaping escapade&mdash;the Esther
      MacLeod case, it was&mdash;back in 1913. The three were a bit younger
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy Lowe was a slim young man with small features that appeared to be
      gathered in the middle of his face. His job might have been thought odd
      anywhere save in the Greenwich Village region. After some years of
      newspaper work he had settled down to the managing editorship of a
      missionary weekly known as <i>My Brother's Keeper</i>. Hy was
      uncommunicative, even irreverent regarding his means of livelihood,
      usually referring to the paper as his meal ticket, and to his employer,
      the Reverend Doctor Hubbell Harkness Wilde (if at all) as the Walrus. In
      leisure moments, perhaps as a chronic reaction from the moral strain of
      his job, Hy affected slang, musical comedy and girls. The partly skinned
      old upright piano in the studio was his. And he had a small gift at
      juggling plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was a philosopher; about Peter's age, sandy in coloring but mild
      in nature, reflective to the point of self-effacement. He read
      interminably, in more than one foreign language and was supposed to write
      book reviews. He had lived in odd corners of the earth and knew Gorki
      personally. His name was Henry Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter came slowly into the studio, threw off coat and hat and stood, the
      beginnings of a complacent smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got my girl,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you've got her, what you gonna do with her?&rdquo; queried Hy Lowe,
      without turning from the new song hit he was picking out on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I gonna do with her?&rdquo; mused Peter, hands deep in pockets, more
      and more pleased with his new attitude of mind&mdash;&ldquo;I'm gonna vivisect
      her, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, cruel one!&rdquo; hummed Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not!&rdquo; cried Peter, rousing. &ldquo;If a girl leaves her home and
      strikes out for the self-expression thing, doesn't she forfeit the
      consideration of decent people? Isn't she fair game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over in the corner by a window, his attention caught by this outbreak, the
      Worm looked up at Peter and reflected for a moment. He was deep in a
      Morris chair, the Worm, clad only in striped pajamas that were not
      over-equipped with buttons, and one slipper of Chinese straw that dangled
      from an elevated foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Pete&mdash;get this!&rdquo; cried Hy, and burst into song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned over his shoulder and sang the choppy refrain with him. In
      the interest of accuracy the two sang it again, The third rendition
      brought them to the borders of harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm looked up again and studied Peter's back, rather absently as if
      puzzling him out and classifying him. He knit his brows. Then his eyes
      lighted, and he turned back in his book, fingering the pages with a mild
      eagerness. Finding what he sought, he read thoughtfully and smiled. He
      closed his book; hitched forward to the old flat-top desk that stood
      between the windows; lighted a caked brier pipe; and after considerable
      scribbling on scraps of paper appeared to hit upon an arrangement of
      phrases that pleased him. These phrases he printed out painstakingly on
      the back of a calling card which he tacked up (with a hair-brush) on the
      outer side of the apartment door. Then he went into the bedroom to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Hy in a low voice. The two were fond of the Worm, but
      they never talked with him about their girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the interesting thing,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I don't know. She's plumb
      mysterious. All she'd tell was that she is playing a boy at that little
      Crossroads Theater of Zanin's, and that I'd have to go there to find her
      out. Going to-night. Want to come along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a looking girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;pretty. Extraordinary eyes, green with brown in 'em&mdash;but
      green. And built like a boy. Very graceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; mused Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like Sue Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Walrus's child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's <i>she</i> doing, playing around the Village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's an old story. She left home&mdash;walked right out. Calls
      herself modern. She's the original lady highbrow, if you ask me. Sure I'll
      go to see her. Even if she never could see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, Hy remarked: &ldquo;The old boy asked me yesterday if I had her address.
      You see he knows we live down here where the Village crowds circulate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Easy enough to get, of course, but I ducked... I'm going to hop into
      the bathtub. There's time enough. Then we can eat at the Parisian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter settled down to read the sporting page of the evening paper. Shortly
      the Worm, clad now, drifted back to the Morris chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Hy shuffle out in his bath slippers and close the outer door
      after him. Then he opened the door and came back, He stood in the doorway,
      holding his bathrobe together with one hand and swinging his towel with
      the ether; and chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You worm!&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Why Bolbo <i>cee</i>ras?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm looked up with mild eyes. &ldquo;Not bolboceeras,&rdquo; he corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolbo<i>es</i>eras. As in cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm merely shrugged his shoulders and resumed his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter paid little heed to this brief conversation. And when he and Hy went
      out, half an hour later, he gave only a passing glance to the card on the
      door. He was occupied with thoughts of a slim girl with green eyes who had
      fascinated and angered him in a most confusing way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The card read as follows:
    </p>
    <h3>
      DO NOT FEED OR ANNOY!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      BOLBOCERAS AMERICANUS MULS

      CHAPTER III&mdash;JACOB ZANIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Crossroads
      Theater was nothing more than an old store, with a shallow stage built in
      at the rear and a rough foyer boarded off at the front. The seats were
      rows of undertaker's chairs, But the lighting was managed with some skill;
      and the scenery, built and painted in the neighborhood, bordered on a
      Barker-Craig-Reinhardt effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Hy stood for a little time in the foyer, watching the audience
      come in. It was a distinctly youthful audience&mdash;the girls and women
      were attractive, most of them Americans; the men running more foreign,
      with a good many Russian Jews among them. They all appeared to be great
      friends. And they handled one another a good deal. Peter, self-conscious,
      hunting copy as always, saw one tired-looking young Jewish painter catch
      the hand of a pretty girl&mdash;an extraordinarily pretty girl, blonde, of
      a slimly rounded figure&mdash;and press and caress her fingers as he
      chatted casually with a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment the girl drew her hand away gently, half-apologetically,
      while a faint wave of color flowed to her transparent cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Peter's blind race prejudice flamed into a little fire of rage. Here
      it was&mdash;his subject&mdash;the restless American girl experimenting
      with life, the selfish bachelor girl, deep in the tangles of Bohemia,
      surrounded by just the experimental men that would be drawn to the
      district by such as she....
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter read it. And he was tom by confused clashing emotions. Then he
      heard a fresh voice cry: &ldquo;Why, hello, Betty!&rdquo; Then he remembered&mdash;this
      girl was the Picabia dancer&mdash;Betty Deane&mdash;her friend! There was
      color in his own face now, and his pulse was leaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said shortly to Hy, &ldquo;let's find our seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first playlet on the bill was Zanin's <i>Any Street.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The theme was the grim influence of street life on the mind of a child. It
      was an uncomfortable little play. All curtains were drawn back. Subjects
      were mentioned that should never, Peter felt, be even hinted at in the
      presence of young women. Rough direct words were hurled at that audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, blushing, peered about him. There sat the young women and girls by
      the dozen, serene of face, frankly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hy, overcome by his tangled self-consciousness, actually lowered his
      head and pressed his handkerchief to his fiery face, murmuring: &ldquo;This is
      no place for a minister's assistant!&rdquo; And he added, in Peter's ear: &ldquo;Lord,
      if the Walrus could just see this&mdash;once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a newsboy came running on the stage&mdash;slim, light of foot&mdash;dodged
      cowering in a saloon doorway, and swore at an off-stage policeman from
      whose clutches he had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a swift pattering of applause; and a whisper ran through the
      audience. Peter heard one voice say: &ldquo;There she is&mdash;that's Sue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat erect, on the edge of his chair. Again the hot color surged into
      his face. He felt it there and was confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his girl of the apple, in old coat and knickerbockers, tom
      stockings, torn shirt open at the neck, a ragged felt hat over her short
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter felt his resentment fading. He knew as he watched her move about the
      stage that she had the curious electric quality that is called
      personality. It was in her face and the poise of her head, in the lines of
      her body, in every easy movement. She had a great gift..
    </p>
    <p>
      After this play the two went outside to smoke, very silent, suppressed
      even. Neither knew what to think or what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Zanin found them (for Peter was, after all, a bit of a personage)
      and made them his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Peter found himself behind the scenes, meeting the
      youthful, preoccupied members of the company and watching with
      half-suppressed eagerness the narrow stairway by which Sue Wilde must
      sooner or later mount from the region of dressing-rooms below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, just before the curtain was rung up on the second play, he was
      rewarded by the appearance of Betty Deane, followed by the tam o'shanter
      and the plaid coat of his apple girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if her heart was jumping as his was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the electric thrill of this meeting, here among heaps of scenery
      and properties, must have touched her, too. He could not believe that it
      began and ended with himself. There was magic in the occasion, such magic
      as an individual rarely generates alone. But if it touched her, she gave
      no outward sign. To Zanin's casual, &ldquo;Oh, you know each other,&rdquo; she
      responded with a quite matter-of-fact smile and nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the audience, and up an aisle to seats in the rear of
      the hall&mdash;Betty first, then Sue and Peter, then Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter felt the thrill again in walking just behind her, aware through his
      very nerve-rips of her grace and charm of movement. When he stood aside to
      let her pass on to her seat her sleeve brushed his arm; and the arm, his
      body, his brain, tingled and flamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin joined them after the last play and led them to a basement
      restaurant near the Square. Hy paired off with Betty and made progress.
      But then, Betty was evidently more Hy's sort than Sue was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the restaurant, Peter, silent, gloomy, watched his chance for a word
      aside with Sue. When it came, he said: &ldquo;I'm very glad you told me to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liked it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appeared to silence her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have distinction Your performance was really interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some ways you are the most gifted girl I have ever seen. Listen! I
      must see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have a bite together one of these evenings&mdash;at the Parisian or
      Jim's. I want to talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be pleasant,&rdquo; said she, after a moment's hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening, perhaps?&rdquo; Peter suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was not answered; for in some way the talk became general
      just then. Later Peter was sure that Sue herself had a hand in making it
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin turned suddenly to Peter. He was a big young man, with a strong if
      peasant-like face and a look of keenness about the eyes. There was
      exuberant force in the man, over which his Village manner of sophisticated
      casualness toward all things lay like the thinnest of veneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what do you think of Sue here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter repeated his impressions with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to do big things with her,&rdquo; said Zanin. &ldquo;Big things. You
      wait. <i>Any Street</i> is just a beginning.&rdquo; And then an impetuous
      eagerness rushing up in him, his topic shifted from Sue to himself. With a
      turbulent, passionate egotism he recounted his early difficulties in
      America, his struggles with the language, heart-breaking summers as a book
      agent, newspaper jobs in middle-western cities, theatrical press work from
      Coast to Coast, his plunge into the battle for a higher standard of
      theatrical art and the resulting fight, most desperate of his life thus
      far, to attract attention to the Crossroads Theater and widen its
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zarin was vehement now. Words poured in a torrent from his lips. He talked
      straight at you, gesturing, with a light in his eye and veiled power in
      his slightly husky voice. Peter felt this power, and something not unlike
      a hatred of the man took sudden root within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think me foolish to give my strength to this struggle. Like you,
      I know these Americans. You can tell me nothing about them. Oh, I have
      seen them, lived with them&mdash;in the city, in the small village, on the
      farm. I know that they are ignorant of Art, that they do not care.&rdquo; He
      snapped his big fingers. &ldquo;Vaudeville, baseball, the girl show, the comic
      supplement, the moving picture&mdash;that is what they like! Yet year
      after year, I go on fighting for the barest recognition. They do not
      understand. They do not care. They believe in money, comfort, conformity&mdash;above
      all conformity. They are fools. But I know them, I tell you! And I know
      that they will listen to me yet! I have shown them that I can fight for my
      ideals. Before we are through I shall show them that I can beat them at
      their own game. They shall see that I mean business. I shall show them
      their God Success in his full majesty.... And publicity? They are
      children. When I have finished they&mdash;-the best of them&mdash;-will
      come to me for kindergarten lessons in publicity. I'm hoping to talk with
      you about it, Mann, I can interest you. I wouldn't bring it to you unless
      I <i>knew</i> I could interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned toward Sue. &ldquo;And this girl shall help me. She has the talent,
      the courage, the breeding. She will surprise the best of them. They will
      find her pure gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hushed with his own enthusiasm, he dropped his hand over one of Sue's;
      took hers up in both of his and moved her slender fingers about as he
      might have played absently with a handkerchief or a curtain string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy, across the table, took this in; and noted too the swift, hot
      expression that flitted across Peter's face and the sudden set to his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue, alter a moment, quietly withdrew her hand. But she did not flush, as
      Betty had flushed in somewhat similar circumstances a few hours earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter laid his hands on the table; pushed back his chair; and, lips
      compressed, got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Zanin&mdash;&ldquo;not going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; Peter replied, slowly, coldly. &ldquo;I have work to do. It has been
      very pleasant. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And out he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy, after some hesitation, followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not speak until they were nearly across the Square. Then he
      remembered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Walrus asked you where she was, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sure did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worried about her, I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's worried, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing more. At the rooms, He partly undressed in silence. Now
      and again his long face worked in mute expression of conflicting emotions
      within. Suddenly he stopped undressing and went into the studio (he slept
      in there, on the couch) and sat by the window, peering out at the sights
      of the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy watched him curiously; then called out a good night, turned off the gas
      and tumbled into bed. His final remark, the cheery observation&mdash;&ldquo;I'll
      tell you this much, my son. Friend Betty is some pippin!&rdquo; drew forth no
      response.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;A LITTLE JOURNEY IN PARANOIA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ALF an hour later
      Peter tiptoed over and closed the door. Then he sat down at his
      typewriter, removed the paper he had left in it, put in a new sheet and
      struck off a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat still, then, in a sweat. The noise of the keys fell on his tense
      ears like the crackling thunder of a machine gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the paper out and tore it into minute pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got another sheet, sat down at the desk and wrote a few hurried
      sentences in longhand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed it in an envelope, glancing nervously about the room; addressed
      it; and found a stamp in the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tiptoed down the room, softly opened the door and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy was snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole into the bedroom, found his clothes in the dark and deliberately
      dressed, clear to overcoat and hat. He slipped out into the corridor, rang
      for the elevator and went out across the Square to the mail box. There was
      a box in the hall down-stairs; but he had found it impossible to post that
      letter before the eyes of John, the night man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood motionless, one hand gripping the box, the other
      holding the letter in air&mdash;a statue of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw a sauntering policeman, shivered, dropped the letter in and
      almost ran home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had done the one thing that he himself, twelve hours earlier, would
      have regarded as utterly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sent an anonymous letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was addressed to the Reverend Hubbell Harkness
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilde, Scripture House, New York. It conveyed to that vigorous if
      pietistic gentleman the information that he would find his daughter, on
      the following evening, Saturday, performing on the stage of the Crossroads
      Theater, Tenth Street, near Fourth: with the added hint that it might not,
      even yet be too late to save her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Peter, all in a tremor now, knew that he meant to be at the Crossroads
      Theater himself to see this little drama of surprises come off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact developed when Hy came back from the office on Saturday that he
      was meditating a return engagement with his new friend Betty. &ldquo;The subject
      was mentioned,&rdquo; he explained, rather self-consciously, to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm came in then and heard Hy speak of <i>Any Street</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that piece of Zanin's! I've meant to see it. You
      fellows going to-night? I'll join you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the three Seventh-Story Men ate at the Parisian and set forth for their
      little adventure; Peter and Hy each with his own set of motives locked up
      in his breast, the Worm with no motives in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter smoked a cigar; the Worm his pipe; and Hy, as always, a cigarette.
      All carried sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter walked in the middle; his face rather drawn; peeking out ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy swung his stick; joked about this and that; offered an experimentally
      humorous eye to every young woman that passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm wore the old gray suit that he could not remember to keep
      pressed, soft black hat, flowing tie, no overcoat. A side pocket bulged
      with a paper-covered book in the Russian tongue. He had an odd way of
      walking, the Worm, throwing his right leg out and around and toeing in
      with his right foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the little theater, Peter's pulse beat a tattoo against his
      temples. What if old Wilde hadn't received the letter! If he had, would he
      come! If he came, what would happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      He came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and the Worm were standing near the inner entrance, Waiting for Hy,
      who, cigarette drooping from his nether lip, stood in the me at the ticket
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a man appeared&mdash;a stranger, from the casually curious
      glances he drew&mdash;elbowing in through the group in the outer doorway
      and made straight for the young poet who was taking tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not see him at first. Then the Worm nudged his elbow and
      whispered&mdash;&ldquo;Good God, it's the Walrus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter wheeled about. He had met the man only once or twice, a year back;
      now he took him in&mdash;a big man, heavy in the shoulders and neck, past
      middle age, with a wide thin orator's mouth surrounded by deep lines. He
      had a big hooked nose (a strong nose!) and striking vivid eyes of a pale
      green color. They struck you, those eyes, with their light hard surface.
      There were strips of whiskers on each cheek, narrow and close-clipped,
      tinged with gray. His clothes, overcoat and hat were black; his collar a
      low turnover; his tie a loosely knotted white bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an oddly dramatic figure in that easy, merry Bohemian setting; a
      specter from an old forgotten world of Puritanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intruder addressed the young poet at the door in a low but determined
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Miss Susan Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you can't now, sir. She will be in costume by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In costume, eh?&rdquo; Doctor Wilde was frowning. And the poet eyed him with
      cool suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is in the first play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the big man frowned and compressed that wide mobile mouth. Peter,
      all alert., sniffing out the copy trail, noted that he was nervously
      clasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Doctor Wilde spoke, with a sudden ring in his voice that gave a
      fleeting hint of inner suppressions. &ldquo;Will you kindly send word to Miss
      Wilde that her father is here and must see her at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poet, surprised, sent the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter heard a door open, down by the stage. He pressed forward, peering
      eagerly. A ripple of curiosity and friendly interest ran through that part
      of the audience that was already seated. A young man called, &ldquo;What's your
      hurry, Sue?&rdquo; and there was laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw her, coming lightly, swiftly up the side aisle; in the boy
      costume&mdash;the knickerbockers, the torn stockings, the old coat and
      ragged hat, the tom shirt, open at the neck. She seemed hardly to hear the
      noise. Her lips were compressed, and Peter suddenly saw that she in her
      fresh young way looked not unlike the big man at the door, the nervously
      intent man who stood waiting for her with a scowl that wavered into an
      expression of utter unbelief as his eyes took in her costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy came up just then with the tickets, and Peter hurried in after Doctor
      Wilde; then let Hy and the Worm move on without him to their seats,
      lingering shamelessly. His little drama was on. He had announced that he
      would vivisect this girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      He studied her. But she saw nothing but the big gray man there with the
      deeply lined face and the pale eyes&mdash;her father! Peter noted now that
      she had her make-up on; an odd effect around those deep blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two were talking&mdash;low, tense. Some late comers crowded in,
      chatting and laughing. Peter edged closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shouldn't have come here like this,&rdquo; he heard her saying. &ldquo;It
      isn't fair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not here to argue. Once more, will you put on your proper clothes
      and come home with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no shame then&mdash;appearing like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the publicity means nothing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are causing it by coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing to you that your actions are a public scandal?&rdquo; With which
      he handed her a folded paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at it; crumpled in in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel, then, no concern for the position you put me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Wilde was raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl broke out with&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, father! I came out here to meet you
      and stop this thing, settle it, once and for all. It is the best way. I
      will not go with you. I have my own life to live, You must not try to
      speak to me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, her eyes darkly alight in her printed face, her slim body
      quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue! Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilde's voice had been trembling with anger; now, Peter thought, it was
      suddenly near to breaking. He reached out one uncertain hand. And a wave
      of sympathy for the man flooded Peter's thoughts. &ldquo;This is where their
      'freedom,' their 'self-expression' leads them,&rdquo; he thought bitterly.
      Egotism! Selfishness! Spiritual anarchy! It was all summed up, that
      revolt, in the girl's outrageous costume as she stood there before that
      older man, a minister, her own father!
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the new note in her father's voice, hesitated the merest
      instant, but then went straight down the aisle, lips tight, eyes aflame,
      seeing and hearing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage door opened. She ran up the steps, and Peter caught a glimpse of
      the hulking Zanin reaching out with a familiar hand to take her arm and
      draw her within.... He turned back in time to see Doctor Wilde, beaten,
      walking rapidly out to the street, and the poet at the door looking after
      him with an expression of sheer uncomprehending irritation on his keen
      young face. &ldquo;There you have it again!&rdquo; thought Peter. &ldquo;There you have the
      bachelor girl&mdash;and her friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus indulging his emotions, the curtain went up on Zanin's
      little play.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there near the door, trying to listen. He was too excited to sit
      down. Turbulent emotions were rioting within him, making consecutive
      thought impossible. He caught bits of Zanin's rough dialogue. He saw Sue
      make her entrance, heard the shout of delighted approval that greeted her,
      the prolonged applause, the cries of &ldquo;Bully for you, Sue!&rdquo;... &ldquo;You're all
      right, Sue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Peter plunged out the door and walked feverishly about the Village
      streets. He stopped at a saloon and had a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Crossroads Theater fascinated him. He drifted back there and
      looked in. The first play was over. Hy was in a dim corner of the lobby,
      talking confidentially with Betty Deane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sue came out with the Worm, of all persons, at her elbow. So <i>he</i>
      had managed to meet her, too? She wore her street dress and looked
      amazingly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter dodged around the corner. &ldquo;The way to get on with women,&rdquo; he
      reflected savagely, &ldquo;is to have no feelings, no capacity for emotion, be
      perfectly cold blooded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked up to Fourteenth Street and dropped aimlessly into a
      moving-picture show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward eleven he went back to Tenth Street. He even ran a little,
      breathlessly, for fear he might be too late, too late for what, he did not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not. Glancing in at the door, he saw Sue, with Betty, Hy, the
      Worm, Zanin and a few others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly, on an impulse, he found an envelope in his pocket, tore off the
      back, and scribbled, in pencil&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I walk back with you? I want vary much to talk with you. If you could
      slip away from these people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went in then, grave and dignified, bowing rather stiffly. Sue appeared
      not to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to her side and spoke low. She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood came rushing to Peter's face. Anger stirred. He slipped the
      folded envelope into her hand. It was some satisfaction that she had
      either to take it or let them all see it drop. She took it; but Still
      ignored him. Her intent to snub him was clear now, even to the bewildered
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mumbled something, he did not know what, and rushed away as erratically
      as he had come. What had he wanted to say to her, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner he turned and came part way back, slowly and uncertainly.
      But what he saw checked him. The Worm was talking apart with her now. And
      she was looking up into his face with an expression of pleased interest,
      frankly smiling. While Peter watched, the two moved off along the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter walked the streets, in a fever of spirit. One o'clock found him out
      on the high curve of the Williamsburg bridge where he could lean on the
      railing and look down on the river with its colored splashes of light or
      up and across at the myriad twinkling towers of the great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll use her!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She is fair game, I tell you! She will find
      yet that she must listen to me!&rdquo; And turning about on the deserted bridge,
      Peter clenched his fist and shook it at the great still city on the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will all listen to me yet!&rdquo; he cried aloud. &ldquo;Yes, you will&mdash;you'll
      listen!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;PETER TREADS THE HEIGHTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E walked rapidly
      back to the rooms. For his bachelor girl play was swiftly, like magic,
      working itself out all new in his mind, actually taking form from moment
      to moment, arranging and rearranging itself nearer and nearer to a
      complete dramatic story. The big scene was fairly tumbling into form. He
      saw it as clearly as if it were being enacted before his eyes.... Father
      and daughter&mdash;the two generations; the solid Old, the experimental
      selfish New.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see that typical bachelor girl, too. If she looked like Sue Wilde
      that didn't matter. He would teach her a lesson she would never forget&mdash;this
      &ldquo;modern&rdquo; girl who forgets all her parents have done in giving and
      developing her life and thinks only of her own selfish freedom. It should
      be like an outcry from the old hearthstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he saw the picture as only a nerve-racked, soul-weary bachelor can see
      it. There were pleasant lawns in Peter's ideal home and crackling
      fireplaces and merry children and smiling perfect parents&mdash;no
      problems, excepting that one of the unfilial child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boys had to strike out, of course. But the girl should either marry or
      stay at home. He was certain about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      On those who did neither&mdash;on the bachelor girls, with their
      &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; their &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; their cigarettes, their repudiation of all
      responsibility&mdash;on these he would pour the scorn of his genius. Sue
      Wilde, who so plainly thought him uninteresting, should be his target.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would write straight at her, every minute, and a world should hear him!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dark corridor, on the apartment door, a dim square of white caught
      his eye&mdash;the Worm's little placard. An inner voice whispered to light
      a match and read it again. He did so. For he was all inner voices now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was:
    </p>
    <h3>
      DO NOT FEED OR ANNOY
    </h3>
    <h3>
      BOLBOCERAS AMERICANUS MULS
    </h3>
    <h3>
      HABITAT HERE!
    </h3>
    <p>
      He studied it while his match burned out. He knit his brows, puzzled,
      groping after blind thoughts, little moles of thoughts deep in dark
      burrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let himself in. The others were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, in his odd humors, never lacked point or meaning. The placard
      meant something, of course... something that Peter could use....
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm had been reading&mdash;that rather fat book lying even now on the
      arm of the Morris 'chair It was <i>Fabre, on Insect Life</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched it up and turned the pages. He sought the index for that word.
      There it was&mdash;Bolbuceras, page 225. Back then to page 225!
    </p>
    <p>
      He read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... a pretty little black beetle, with a pale, velvety abdomen... Its
      official title is <i>Bulbuceras Gallicus Muls</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, in perplexity. This was hardly self-explanatory. He read on.
      The bolboceras, it began to appear, was a hunter of truffles. Truffles it
      would, must have. It would eat no common food but wandered about sniffing
      out its vegetable prey in the sandy soil and digging for each separate
      morsel, then moving on in its quest. It made no permanent home for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter raised his eyes and stared at the bookcase in the corner. Very
      slowly a light crept into his eyes, an excited smile came to the corners
      of his mouth. There was matter here! And Peter, like Homer, felt no
      hesitation about taking his own where he found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read on, a description of the burrows as explored by the hand of the
      scientist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Often the insect will be found at the bottom of its burrow; sometimes
      a male, sometimes a female, but always alone. The two sexes work apart
      without collaboration. This is no family mansion for the rearing of
      offspring; it is a temporary dwelling, made by each insect for its own
      benefit</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter laid the book down almost reverently and stood gazing out the window
      at the Square. He quite forgot to consider what the Worm had been thinking
      of when he printed out the little placard and tacked it on the door. He
      could see it only as a perfect characterization of the bachelor girls.
      Every one of those girls and women was a <i>Bolboceras</i>, a confirmed
      seeker of pleasures and delicacies in the sober game of life, utterly
      self-indulgent, going it alone&mdash;a truffle hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would call his play, <i>The Bolboceras</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. &ldquo;Buyers from Shreveport would fumble it,&rdquo; he thought, shrewdly
      practical. &ldquo;You've got to use words of one syllable on Broadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paced the room&mdash;back and forth, back and forth. <i>The
      Truffle-Hunter</i>, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty good, that!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no&mdash;wait! He stood motionless in the middle of the long room,
      eyes staring, the muscles of his face strained out of shape, hands
      clenched tightly..He was about to create a new thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The Truffler!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words burst from his lips; so loud that he tiptoed to the door and
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The Truffler</i>,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;<i>The Trifler</i>&mdash;no <i>The
      Truffler</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was riding high, far above all worldly irritations, tolerant even
      toward the little person, Sue Wilde, who had momentarily annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to be stirred,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that was all. Something had to happen
      to rouse me and set my creative self working. New people had to come into
      my life to freshen me. It did happen; they did come, and now I an myself
      again. I shall not have time for them now, these selfish bachelor women
      and there self-styled Jew geniuses. But still I am grateful to them all.
      They have helped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped into the chair by the desk, pulled out his manuscript from a
      drawer and fell to work. It was five in the morning before he crept into
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, his eyes sunken perceptibly, face drawn, color off, Peter
      sat for two hours within a cramped disorderly office, reading aloud to a
      Broadway theatrical manager who wore his hat tipped down over his eyes,
      kept his feet on the mahogany desk, smoked panatelas end on end and who,
      like Peter, was deeply conservative where women were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five-thirty on this same afternoon, Peter, triumphant, acting on a
      wholly unconsidered impulse, rushed around the corner of Broadway and
      Forty-second Street and into the telephone room of a glittering hotel. He
      found Betty Deane's name in the telephone book, and called up the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feminine voice sounded in his ear. He thought it was Sue Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was</i> Sue Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked if she could not dine with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence at the other end of the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; he called anxiously. &ldquo;Hello! Hello!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm here,&rdquo; came the voice. &ldquo;You rather surprised me, Mr. Mann. I
      have an engagement for this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then I can't see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried desperately to think up conversation; but failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;<i>good-by</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Peter ate alone, still overstrung but gloomy now, in the
      glittering hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner, however, was both well-cooked and hot. It tended to soothe and
      soften him. Finally, expansive again, he leaned hack, fingered his coffee
      cup, smoked a twenty-cent cigar and observed the life about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, were many large dressy women, escorted by sharp-looking men of two
      races. There were also small dressy women, some mere girls and pretty, but
      nearly all wearing make-up on cheeks and lips and quite all with extreme,
      sophistication in their eyes. There was shining silver and much white
      linen. Chafing dishes blazed. French and Austrian waiters moved swiftly
      about under the commanding eye of a stern captain. Uniformed but
      pocketless hat boys slipped it and out, pouncing on every loose article of
      apparel.... It was a gay scene; and Peter found himself in it, of it, for
      it. With rising exultation in his heart he reflected that he was back on
      Broadway, where (after all) he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manager of the afternoon came in now, who believed, with Peter, that
      woman's place was the home. He was in evening dress&mdash;a fat man. At
      his side tripped a very young-appearing girl indeed&mdash;the youngest and
      prettiest in the room, but with the make-up and sophistication of the
      others. Men (and women) stared at them as they passed. There was
      whispering; for this was the successful Max Neuerman, and the girl was the
      lucky Eileen O'Rourke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuerrman sighted Peter, greeted him boisterously, himself drew up an
      unoccupied chair. Peter was made acquainted with Miss O'Rourke. &ldquo;This is
      the man, Eileen,&rdquo; said Neuerman, breathing confidences, &ldquo;Wrote <i>The
      Trufiler</i>. Big thing! Absolutely a new note on Broadway! Eric here has
      caught the new bachelor woman, shown her up and put a tag on her. After
      this she'll be called a truffler everywhere.... By the way, Eric, I sent
      the contract down to you to-night by messenger. And the check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Eileen O'Rourke smiled indulgently and a thought absently. While
      Peter lighted, thanks to Neuermnn, a thirty-cent cigar and impulsively
      told Miss O'Rourke (who continued to smile indulgently and absently) just
      how he had come to hit on that remarkable tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly nine o'clock when he left and walked, very erect, from the
      restaurant, conscious of a hundred eyes on his back. He gave the hat boy a
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on Forty-second Street he paused to clear his exuberant but confused
      mind. He couldn't go back to the rooms; not as he felt now. Cabarets bored
      him. It was too early for dancing. Irresolute, he strolled over toward
      Fifth Avenue, crossed it, turned south. A north-bound automobile bus
      stopped just ahead of him. He glanced up at the roof. There appeared to be
      a vacant seat or two. In front was the illuminated sign that meant
      Riverside Drive. It was warm for February.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to take the ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just in front of him, however, also moving toward the bus, was a young
      couple. There was something familiar about them. The girl&mdash;he could
      see by a corner light&mdash;was wearing a boyish coat, a plaid coat. Also
      she wore a tam o'shanter. She partly turned her head... his pulse started
      racing, and he felt the colour rushing into his face. It was Sue Wilde, no
      other!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man? No overcoat. That soft black hat! A glimpse of a flowing tie
      of black silk! The odd trick of throwing his right leg out and around as
      he walked and toeing in with the right foot!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned sharply away, crossed the street and caught a south-bound
      bus. Wavering between irritation, elation and chagrin, he walked in and
      out among the twisted old streets of Greenwich Village. Four distinct
      times&mdash;and for no clear reason&mdash;he passed the dingy apartment
      building where Sue and Betty lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he found himself standing motionless on a curb by a battered
      lamp-post, peering through his large horn-rimmed eye-glasses at a
      bill-board across the street on which his name did not appear. He studied
      the twenty-four-sheet poster of a cut plug tobacco that now occupied the
      space. There was light enough in the street to read it by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he turned and looked to the right. Then he looked to the left.
      Fumbling for a pencil, he moved swiftly and resolutely across the street.
      Very small, down in the right-hand corner of the tobacco advertisement, he
      wrote his name&mdash;his pen name&mdash;&ldquo;Eric Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, more nearly at peace with himself, he went to the moving pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the rooms later, he found the Worm settled, in pajamas as usual,
      with a book in the Morris chair. He also found a big envelope from
      Neuerman with the contract in it and a check for a thousand dollars,
      advanced against royalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a brown check. He fingered it for a moment, while his spirits
      recorded their highest mark for the day. Then, outwardly calm, he put it
      in an inside coat pocket and with a fine air of carelessness tossed the
      contract to the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm put down his book and studied Peter rather thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; he finally said, &ldquo;I've got a message for you, and I've been
      sitting here debating whether to deliver it or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have it!&rdquo; replied <i>the</i> Eric Mann shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm produced a folded envelope from the pocket of his pajamas and
      handed it ever. &ldquo;I haven't been told what's in it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, with a tremor, unfolded the envelope and peered inside. There were
      two enclosures&mdash;one plainly his scribbled note to Sue; the other (he
      had to draw it partly out and examine it)&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes,
      his anonymous letter, much crumpled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately, rather white about the mouth, Peter moved to the fireplace,
      touched a match to the papers and watched them burn. That done, he turned
      and queried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? That all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm shook his head. &ldquo;Not quite all, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Words suddenly came from Peter. &ldquo;What do I care for that girl! A creative
      artist has his reactions, of course. He even does foolish things. Look at
      Wagner, Burns, Cellini, Michael Angelo&mdash;look at the things they used
      to do!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her message is,&rdquo; continued the Worm, &ldquo;the suggestion that next time you
      write one of them with your left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter thought this over. The check glowed next to his heart. It thrilled
      him. &ldquo;You tell your friend Sue Wilde,&rdquo; he replied then, with dignity,
      &ldquo;that my message to her&mdash;and to you&mdash;will be delivered next
      September across the footlights of the Astoria Theater.&rdquo; And he strode
      into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm looked after him with quizzical eyes, smiled a little and resumed
      his book.

      stealthily into the rooms on the seventh floor of the old bachelor
      apartment building in Washington Square. His right hand, deep in a pocket
      of his spring overcoat, clutched a thin, very new book bound in
      pasteboard. It was late on a Friday afternoon, near the lamb-like close of
      March.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were empty. Which fact brought relief to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the studio to the decrepit flat-top desk between the two
      windows. With an expression of gravity, almost of solemnity, on his long
      face, lie unlocked the middle drawer on the end next the wail. Within, on
      a heap of manuscripts, letters and contracts, lay five other thin little
      books in gray, buff and pink. He spread these in a row on the desk and
      added the new one. On each was the name of a savings bank, printed, and
      his own name, written. They represented savings aggregating now nearly
      seven thousand dollars.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Seven thousand dollars, for a bachelor of thirty-three may seem enough to
      you. It did not seem enough to Peter. In fact he was now studying the six
      little books through his big horn-rimmed glasses (not spectacles) with
      more than a suggestion of anxiety. Peter was no financier; and the thought
      of adventuring his savings on the turbulent uncharted seas of finance
      filled his mind with terrors. Savings banks appealed to him because they
      were built solidly, of stone, and had immense iron gratings at windows and
      doors. And, too, you couldn't draw money without going to some definite
      personal trouble.... It is only fair to add that the books represented all
      he had or would ever have unless he could get more. Nobody paid Peter a
      salary. No banker or attorney had a hand in taxing his income at the
      source. <i>The Truffler</i> might succeed and make him mildly rich. Or it
      might die in a night, leaving the thousand-dollar &ldquo;advance against
      royalties&rdquo; as his entire income from more than a year of work. His last
      two plays had failed, you know. Plays usually failed. Eighty or ninety per
      cent, of them&mdash;yes, a good ninety!
    </p>
    <p>
      Theoretically, the seven thousand dollars should carry him two or three
      years. Practically, they might not carry him one. For he couldn't possibly
      know in advance what he would do with them. Genius laughs at savings
      banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter sighed, put the six little books away and locked the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locked it with sudden swiftness and caution, for Hy Lowe just then burst
      in the outer door and dove, humming a one-step, into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, pocketing the keys carefully so that they would not jingle, put on
      a casual front and followed him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy, still in overcoat and hat, was gazing with rapt eyes at a snap-shot of
      two girls. He laughed a little, self-consciously, at the sight of Peter
      and set the picture against the mirror on his side of the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other pictures stuck about Hy's end of the mirror; all of girls
      and not all discreet. One of these, pushed aside to make room for the new
      one, fell to the floor. Hy let it lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned ever and peered at the snap-shot. He recognized the two girls
      as Betty Deane and Sue Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having a dish of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you ever work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since friend Betty turned up, my son, I'm wondering if I ever shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter grunted. His gaze was centered not on Hy's friend Betty, but on the
      slim familiar figure at the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just you two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue came in. Look here, Pete, I'm generous. We're going to cut it in
      half. I get Betty, you get Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, deepening gloom on his face, sat down abruptly on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, my son,&rdquo; observed Hy sagely, &ldquo;or that girl will be going to your
      head. That's your trouble, Pete; you take 'em seriously. And believe me,
      it won't do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that, Hy&mdash;I'm not in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence while Hy removed garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that,&rdquo; protested Peter again. &ldquo;No, it isn't that. She irritates
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy took off his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any&mdash;anybody else there?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that fellow Zanin. He came in with Sue. By the way, he wants to see
      you. Seems to have an idea he can interest you in a scheme he's got.
      Talked quite a lot about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not hear all of this. At the mention of Zanin he got up suddenly
      and rushed off into the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy glanced after him; then hummed (more softly, out of a new respect for
      Peter) a hesitation waltz as he cut the new picture in half with the
      manicure scissors and put Sue on Peter's side of the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm came in, dropped coat and hat on a chair and settled himself to
      his pipe and the evening paper. Peter, stretched on the couch, greeted him
      with a grunt. Hy appeared, in undress, and attacked the piano with
      half-suppressed exuberance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Worm's settled habit to read straight through the paper without
      a word; then to stroll out to dinner, alone or with the other two, as it
      happened, either silent or making quietly casual remarks that you didn't
      particularly need to answer if you didn't feel like it. He made no demands
      on you, the Worm. He wasn't trivial and gay, like Hy; or burning with
      inner ambitions and desires, like Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, however, he broke bounds. Slowly the paper, not half
      read, sank to his knees. He smoked up a pipeful thus. His sandy thoughtful
      face was sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw Sue Wilde to-day. Met her outside the Parisian, and we had lunch
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shot a glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, oblivious to Peter, tamped his pipe with a pencil and spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been trying to make her out. She and I have had several talks. I can't
      place her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was so unusual&mdash;from the Worm it amounted to an outburst!&mdash;that
      even Hy, swinging around from the yellow keyboard, waited in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows know Greenwich Village,&rdquo; the musing one went on, puffing
      slowly and following with his eyes the curling smoke. &ldquo;You know the dope&mdash;-'Oats
      for Women!' somebody called it&mdash;that a woman must be free as a man,
      free to go to the devil if she chooses. You know, so often, when these
      feminine professors of freedom talk to you how they over-emphasize the sex
      business&mdash;by the second quarter-hour you find yourself solemnly
      talking woman's complete life, rights of the unmarried mother, birth
      control; and after you've got away from the lady you can't for the life of
      you figure out how those topics ever got started, when likely as not you
      were thinking about your job or the war or Honus Wagner's batting slump.
      You know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy nodded, with a quizzical look. Peter was motionless and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;I don't want to knock; got too much respect for the real
      idealists here in the Village&mdash;but you fellows do know how you get to
      anticipating that stuff and discounting it before it comes; and you can't
      help seeing that the woman is more often than not just dressing up
      ungoverned desires in sociological language, that she's leaping at the
      chance to experiment with emotions that women have had to suppress for
      ages. Back of it is the new Russianism they live and breathe&mdash;to know
      no right or wrong, trust your instincts, respond to your emotions, bow to
      your desires.... Well, now, here's Sue Wilde. She looks like a regular
      little radical. And acts it. Breaks away from her folks&mdash;lives with
      the regular bunch in the Village&mdash;takes up public dancing and acting&mdash;smokes
      her cigarettes&mdash;knows her Strindberg and Freud&mdash;yet... well,
      I've dined with her once, lunched with her once, spent five hours in her
      apartment talking Isadora Duncan as against Pavlowa, even walked the
      streets half a night arguing about what she calls the Truth... and we
      haven't got around to 'the complete life' yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you dope it out?&rdquo; asked Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;the Worm deliberately thought out his reply&mdash;&ldquo;I think
      she's so. Most of 'em aren't so. She's a real natural oasis in a desert of
      poseurs. Probably that's why I worry about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why worry?&rdquo; From Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. But I do. It's the situation she has drifted into, I
      suppose. If she was really mature you'd let her look out for herself. It's
      the old he protective instinct in me, I suppose. The one thing on earth
      she would resent more than anything else. But this fellow Zanin...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He painstakingly made a smoke ring and sent it toward the tarnished brass
      hook on the window-frame. It missed. He tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stirred uncomfortably, there on the couch. &ldquo;What has she told you
      about Zanin?&rdquo; he asked, desperately controlling his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't know that she has told me much of anything. But she has
      talked her work and prospects. And the real story comes through. Just this
      afternoon since I left her, it has been piecing itself together. She is
      frank, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter suppressed a groan. She was frank! &ldquo;Zanin is in love with her. He
      has been for a year or more. He wrote <i>Any Street</i> for her,
      incorporated some of her own ideas in it. He has been tireless at helping
      her work up her dancing and pantomime. Why, as near as I can see, the man
      has been downright devoting his life to her, all this time. It's rather
      impressive. But then, Zanin <i>is</i> impressive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter broke out now. &ldquo;Does he expect to marry her&mdash;Zanin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry her? Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, no!' Good God then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Pete, you surely know Zanin's attitude toward marriage. He has
      written enough on the subject. And lectured&mdash;and put it in those
      little plays of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> his attitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That marriage is immoral. Worse than immoral&mdash;vicious. He has
      expounded that stuff for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does she say to all this?&rdquo; This question came from Hy, for Peter
      was speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply that he doesn't rouse any emotional response in her. I'm not sure
      that she isn't a little sorry he doesn't. She would be honest you know.
      And that's the thing about Sue&mdash;my guess about her, at least&mdash;that
      she won't approach love as an experiment or an experience. It will have to
      be the real thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried again, in his slow calm way, to hang a smoke ring on the brass
      hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said Hy. &ldquo;Your narrative interests me strangely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Worm slowly, &ldquo;Zanin is about ready to put over his big
      scheme. He has contrived at last to get one of the managers interested.
      And it hangs on Sue's personality. The way he has worked it out with her,
      planning it as a concrete expression of that half wild, natural self of
      hers, I doubt if it, this particular thing, could be done without her. It
      <i>is</i> Sue&mdash;an expressed, interpreted Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be the thing he is trying to get Pete in on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. Zanin knows that where he fails is on the side of popularity.
      He has intelligence, but he hasn't the trick of reaching the crowd. And he
      is smart enough to see what he needs and go after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going after the crowd, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of the noble artistic standards he's been bleeding and
      dying for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. He really has been bleeding and dying. You have to admit
      that. He lives in one mean room, over there in Fourth Street. A good deal
      of the little he eats he cooks with his own hands on a kerosene stove.
      Those girls are always taking him in and feeding him up. He works twenty
      and thirty hours at a stretch over his productions at the Crossroads. Must
      have the constitution of a bull elephant. If it was just a matter of
      picking up money, he could easily go back into newspaper work or the
      press-agent game.... I'm not sure that the man isn't full of a struggling
      genius that hasn't really begun to find expression. If he is, it will
      drive him into bigger and bigger things. He won't worry about consistency&mdash;he'll
      just do what every genius does. he'll fight his way through to complete
      self-expression, blindly, madly, using everything that comes in his way,
      trampling on everything that he can't use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, twitching with irritation, sat up and snorted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, what's the <i>scheme!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm regarded Peter thoughtfully and not unhumorously, as if
      reflecting further over his observations on genius. Then he explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's going to preach the Greenwich Village freedom on every little
      moving-picture screen in America&mdash;shout the new naturalism to a
      hypocritical world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he worked out his story?&rdquo; asked Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the rough, I think. But he wants a practical theatrical man to give it
      form and put it over. That's where Pete comes in.... Get it? It's during
      stuff. He'll use Sue's finest quality, her faith, as well as her grace of
      body. What I could get out of it sounds a good deal like the Garden of
      Eden story without the moral. An Artzibasheff paradise. Sue says that
      she'll have to wear a pretty primitive costume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which doesn't bother her, I imagine,&rdquo; said Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, leaning back on stiff arms, staring at the opposite wall, suddenly
      found repictured to his mind's eye a dramatic little scene: In the
      Crossroads Theater, out by the ticket entrance; the audience in their
      seats, old Wilde, the Walrus himself, in his oddly primitive', early
      Methodist dress&mdash;long black coat, white bow tie, narrow strip of
      whisker on each grim cheek; Sue in her newsboy costume, hair cut short
      under the ragged felt hat, face painted for the stage, her deep-green eyes
      blazing. The father had said: &ldquo;You have no shame, then&mdash;appearing
      like this?&rdquo; To which the daughter had replied: &ldquo;No&mdash;none!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy was speaking again. &ldquo;You don't mean to say that Zanin will be able to
      put this scheme over on Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm nodded, very thoughtful. &ldquo;Yes, she is going into it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter broke cut again: &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;but....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows want to get this thing straight in your heads,&rdquo; the Worm
      continued, ignoring Peter. &ldquo;Her reasons aren't by any means so weak. In
      the first place the thing comes to her as a real chance to express in the
      widest possible way her own protest against conventionality. As Zanin has
      told her, she will be able to express naturalness and honesty of life to
      millions where Isadora Duncan, with all her perfect art, can only reach
      thousands. Yes, Zanin is appealing to her best qualities. And, at that,
      I'm not at all sure that he isn't honest in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest!&rdquo; snorted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, honest. I don't say he is. I say I'm not sure.... Then another
      argument with her is that he has really been helping her to grow. He has
      given her a lot&mdash;and without making any crude demands. Obligations
      have grown up there, you see. She knows that his whole heart is in it,
      that it's probably his big chance; and while the girl is modest enough she
      can see how dependent the whole plan is on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;Peter again!&mdash;&ldquo;think what she'll find
      herself up against&mdash;the people she'll have to work with&mdash;the
      vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; mused the Worm. &ldquo;I'm not sure it would bother her much.
      Those things don't seem to touch her. And she isn't the sort to be stopped
      by conventional warnings, anyway. She'll have to find it out all for
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm gave himself up again to the experiment with smoke rings. He blew
      one&mdash;another&mdash;a third&mdash;at the curtain hook..The fourth
      wavered down over the hook, hung a second, broke and trailed off into the
      atmosphere. &ldquo;.Got it!&rdquo; said the Worm, to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's the manager he's picked up?&rdquo; asked Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow named Silverstone. Head of a movie producing company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, to whom this name was, apparently, the last straw, shivered a
      little, sprang to his feet, and for the second time within the hour rushed
      blindly off into solitude.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;PETER THINKS ABOUT THE PICTURES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Hy set out for
      dinner, a little later, he found Peter sitting on a bench in the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in and get your overcoat,&rdquo; said Hy. &ldquo;Unless you're out for pneumonia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hy,&rdquo; said Peter, his color vivid, his eyes wild, &ldquo;we can't let those
      brutes play with Sue; like that. We've got to save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy squinted down at his bamboo stick. &ldquo;Very good, my son. But just how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could talk with her, Hy!... I know that game so well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could call her up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call her up nothing! I can't ask to see her and start cold.&rdquo; He gestured
      vehemently. &ldquo;Look here, you're seeing Betty every day&mdash;you fix it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy mused. &ldquo;They're great hands to take tramps in the country, those two.
      Most every Sunday.... If I could arrange a little party of four.... See
      here! Betty's going to have dinner with me to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Hy, get me in on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you just wait! Sue'll be playing to-morrow night at the Crossroads,
      It's Saturday, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it gives me the chance to talk it over with friend Betty and perhaps
      plan for Sunday. If Zanin'll just leave her alone that long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't as if I were thinking of myself, Hy...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl's in danger. We've <i>got</i> to save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if she won't listen! She's high-strung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peter, flaring up with a righteous passion that made him feel
      suddenly like the hero of his own new play&mdash;&ldquo;then I'll go straight to
      Zanin and force him to declare himself! I will face him, as man to man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the two Seventh-Story Men!
    </p>
    <p>
      At moments, during the few weeks just past, thoughts of his anonymous
      letter had risen to disturb Peter; on each occasion, until to-night, to be
      instantly overwhelmed by the buoyant egotism that always justified Peter
      to himself. But the thoughts had been there. They had kept him from
      attempts to see Sue, had even restrained him from appearing where there
      was likelihood of her seeing him; and they had kept him excited about her.
      Now they rose again in unsuspected strength. Of course she would refuse to
      see him! He slept hardly at all that night. The next day he was unstrung.
      And Saturday night (or early Sunday morning) when Hy crept in, Peter, in
      pajamas, all lights out, was sitting by the window nursing a headache,
      staring out with smarting eyeballs at the empty Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worm here?&rdquo; asked Hy guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy lighted the gas; then looked closely at the wretched Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my son,&rdquo; he said then, &ldquo;you need sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo;&mdash;muttered Peter, &ldquo;good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but you've got a delicate job on your hands. It'll take
      expert handling. You've got to be fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you see Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only Betty. But they've been talking you over. Sue told Betty that
      you interest her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;she did! Say anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less. Look here&mdash;has anything happened that I'm not in on? I
      mean between you and Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shivered slightly. &ldquo;How could anything happen? I haven't been seeing
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Sue says you're the strangest man she ever knew. She can't
      figure you out. Betty was wondering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy was removing his overcoat now. Suddenly he gave way to a soft little
      chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, don't laugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of something else. Yes, I fixed it. But there's something
      up&mdash;a new deal. This here Silverstone saw <i>Any Street</i> last
      night and went dippy over Sue. Betty told me that much but says she can't
      tell me the rest because it's Sue's secret, not hers. Only it came out
      that Zanin has dropped the idea of bringing you into it. Silverstone
      bought supper for the girls and Zanin last night, and this afternoon he
      took Zanin out to his Long Beach house for the night, in a big car. And
      took his stenographer along. Everybody's mysterious and in a hurry. Oh,
      there's a hen on, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I'm out!&rdquo; muttered Peter between set teeth. &ldquo;But it's no mystery.
      Think I don't know Silverstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freeze out everybody and put Sue across himself. What's that guy's is
      his. Findings is keepings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will Sue let him freeze Zanin out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a point.... But if she won't, he'll he wise in a minute. Trust
      Silverstone! He'll let Zanin <i>think</i> he's in, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things look worse, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy was undressing. He sat now, caught by a sudden fragrant memory, holding
      a shoe in midair, and chuckled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that cackle!&rdquo; growled Peter. &ldquo;You said you fixed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. Quit abusing me and you'll realize that I'm coming through with
      all you could ask. We leave at eleven, Hudson Tunnel, for the Jersey hills&mdash;we
      four. I bring the girls; you meet us at the Tunnel. Zanin is safe at Long
      Beach. We eat at a country road house. We walk miles in the open country.
      We drift home in the evening, God knows when!... Here I hand you, in one
      neat parcel, pleasant hillsides, purling brooks, twelve mortal hours of
      the blessed damosel, and&rdquo;&mdash;he caught up the evening paper&mdash;&ldquo;'fair
      and warmer'&mdash;and perfect weather. And what do I get? Abuse. Nothing
      but abuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, he deftly juggled his two shoes, caught both in a final
      flourish, looked across at the abject Peter and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; muttered Peter wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir. And you go to bed. Your nerves are a mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into Peter's brain as he hurried toward the Tunnel Station, the next
      morning, darted an uninvited, startling thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was Zanin, idealist in the drama, prophet of the new Russianism,
      deserting the stage for the screen!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it the Worm had represented him as saying to Sue... that she
      would be enabled to express her ideals to millions where Isadora Duncan
      could reach only thousands?
    </p>
    <p>
      Millions in place of thousands!
    </p>
    <p>
      His imagination pounced on the thought. He stopped short on the street to
      consider it&mdash;until a small boy laughed; then he hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked with new eyes at the bill-boards he passed. Two-thirds of them
      flaunted moving-picture features.... He had been passing such posters for
      a year or more without once reading out of them a meaning personal to
      himself. He had been sticking blindly, doggedly to plays&mdash;ninety per
      cent, of which, of all plays, failed utterly. It suddenly came home to him
      that the greatest dramatists, like the greatest actors and actresses, were
      working for the camera. All but himself, apparently!... The theaters were
      fighting for the barest existence where they were not surrendering
      outright. Why, he himself patronized movies more often than plays! Yet he
      had stupidly refused to catch the significance of it.... <i>The Truffler</i>
      would fail, of course; just as the two before it had failed. Still he had,
      until this actual minute, clung to it as his one hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millions for thousands!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking now not of persons but of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millions for thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused at a news stand. Sprawled over it were specimens of the new sort
      of periodical, the moving-picture magazines. So the publishers, like the
      theatrical men, were being driven back by the invader.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought the fattest, most brightly colored of these publications and
      turned the pages eagerly as he descended into the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood half-hidden behind a pillar, his eyes wandering from the magazine
      to the ticket gate where Hy and the two girls would appear, then back to
      the magazine. Those pages reeked of enthusiasm, fresh ideas, prosperity.
      They stirred new depths within his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his little party coming in through the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls wore sweaters. Their skirts were short, their tan shoes low
      and flat of heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were attractive, each in her individual way; Sue less regular as to
      features, but brighter, slimmer, more alive. Betty's more luxurious figure
      was set off almost too well by the snug sweater. As she moved, swaying a
      little from the hips, her eyelids drooping rather languidly, the color
      stirring faintly under her fair fine skin, she was, Peter decided,
      unconscious neither of the sweater nor of the body within it.... Just
      before the train roared in, while Sue, all alertness, was looking out
      along the track, Peter saw Hy's hand brush Betty's. For an instant their
      fingers intertwined; then the hands drifted casually apart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;SUE WALKS OVER A HILL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER joined them&mdash;a
      gloomy man, haunted by an anonymous letter. Sue was matter-of-fact. It
      seemed to Hy that she made some effort to put the well-known playwright
      more nearly at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lurched, an hour's ride out in Northern New Jersey, at a little
      motorists' tavern that Hy guided them to. They sat on a shaded veranda
      while the men smoked cigars and the girls smoked cigarettes. After which
      they set forth on what was designed to be a four-hour tramp through the
      hills to another railroad&mdash;Sue and Peter ahead (as it turned out); Hy
      and Betty lagging behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road curved over hills and down into miniature valleys. There were
      expanses of plowed fields, groves of tall bare trees, groups of
      farmhouses. Robins hopped beside the road. The bright sun mitigated the
      crisp sting in the air. A sense of early spring touched eye and ear and
      nostril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter felt it; breathed more deeply; actually smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue threw back her head and hummed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy and Betty dropped farther and farther behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Sue turned and waved them on; then stood and laughed with sheer good
      humor at their deliberate, unrhythmical step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said to Peter &ldquo;They don't get it&mdash;the joy of it. You
      have to walk with a steady swing. It takes you a mile or two, at that, to
      get going. When I'm in my stride, it carries me along so I hate to stop at
      all. You know, you can't pick it up again right off&mdash;the real swing.
      Walking is a game&mdash;a fine game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter didn't know. He had never thought of walking as a game. He played
      golf a little, tennis a little less. It had always been difficult for him
      to hold his mind on these unimportant pursuits. But he found himself
      responding eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've gone in a lot for athletics,&rdquo; said he, thinking of the lightness,
      the sheer ease, with which she had moved about the little Crossroads
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;at school and college&mdash;basket ball, running, fencing,
      dancing and this sort of thing. Dancing especially. I've really worked
      some at that, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he moodily, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They swung down into a valley, over a bridge, up the farther slope,
      through a notch and out along a little plateau with a stream winding
      across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter found himself in some danger of forgetting his earnest purpose. He
      could fairly taste the fresh spring air. He could not resist occasionally
      glancing sidelong at his companion and thinking&mdash;&ldquo;She is great in
      that sweater!&rdquo; A new soft magic was stealing in everywhere among what he
      had regarded as his real thoughts and ideas. Once her elbow brushed his;
      and little flames rose in his spirit.... She walked like a boy. She talked
      like a boy. She actually seemed to think like a boy. The Worm's remark
      came to him, with an odd stabbing effect... &ldquo;We haven't got around to 'the
      complete life' yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quite bewildered him. For she distinctly was not a boy. She was a
      young woman. She couldn't possibly be so free from thoughts of self and
      the drama of life, of man and the all-conquering urge of nature! As a
      dramatist, as a student of women, he knew better. No, she couldn't&mdash;no
      more than &ldquo;friend Betty&rdquo; back there, philandering along with Hy, The Worm
      had guaranteed her innocence... but the Worm notoriously didn't understand
      women. No, it couldn't be true. For she <i>had</i> broken away from her
      folks. She <i>did</i> live with the regular bunch in the Village. She <i>did</i>
      undoubtedly know her Strindberg and Freud. She <i>had</i> taken up public
      dancing and acting. She <i>did</i> smoke her cigarettes&mdash;had smoked
      one not half an hour back, publicly, on the veranda of a road house! ...
      He felt again the irritation she had on other occasions stirred in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowed down, tense with this bewilderment. He drew his hand across his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue went on a little ahead; then stopped, turned and regarded him with
      friendly concern!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we started too soon after lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was babying him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no... I was thinking of something!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost angrily he struck out at a swift pace. He would show her who was
      the weakling in <i>this</i> little party! He would make her cry for mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she struck out with him. Swinging along at better than four miles an
      hour they followed the road into another valley and for a mile or two
      along by a bubbling brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Peter who slackened first. His feet began hurting: an old trouble
      with his arches. And despite the tang in the air, he was dripping with
      sweat. He mopped his forehead and made a desperate effort to breathe
      easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue was a thought flushed, there was a shine in her eyes; she danced a few
      steps in the road and smiled happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the thing!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That's the way I love to move along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she liked him better for walking like that. It really seemed to
      make a difference. He set his teeth and struck out again, saying&mdash;&ldquo;All
      right. Let's have some more of it, then!&rdquo; And sharp little pains shot
      through his insteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it's best to slow down for a while. I like to speed up
      just now and then. Besides, I've got something on my mind. Let's talk.&rdquo; He
      walked in silence, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about that other talk we had,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It has bothered me since.
      I told you your plays were dreadful. You remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed shortly. &ldquo;Oh, yes; I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I did hurt you. I must have been perfectly
      outrageous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply to this; merely mopped his forehead again and strode
      along. The pains were shooting above the insteps now, clear up into the
      calves of his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have made myself plainer,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I remember talking as if
      you couldn't write at all. Of course I didn't mean that, and I had no
      right to act as if I held myself superior to a man of your experience.
      That was silly. What I really meant was that you didn't write from a point
      of view that I could accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you said was,&rdquo; observed Peter, aiming at her sort of good-humored
      directness, and missing, &ldquo;'the difficulty is, it's the whole thing&mdash;your
      attitude toward life&mdash;your hopeless sentimentality about women, the
      slushy horrible Broadway falseness that lies back of everything you do&mdash;the
      Broadway thing, always.'... Those were your words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; She was serious now. He thought she looked hurt, almost. The
      thought gave him sudden savage pleasure. &ldquo;Surely, I didn't say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. And you added that my insight into life is just about that of a
      hardened director of one-reel films.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was hurt now. She walked on for a little time, quite silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she stopped short, looked right at him, threw out her hands (he
      noted and felt the grace of the movement!) and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how to answer you. Probably I did say just about those
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are exact... and of course, in one sense, I meant them. I do feel
      that way about your work. But not at all in the personal sense that you
      have taken it. And I recognize your ability as clearly as anybody. Can't
      you see, man&mdash;that's exactly the reason I talked that way to you?&rdquo;
       There was feeling in her voice now. &ldquo;I suppose I had a crazy, kiddish
      notion of converting you, of making you work for us. It was because you
      are so good at it that I went after you like that. You are worth going
      after.&rdquo; She hesitated, and bit her lip. &ldquo;That's why I was so pleased when
      Zanin thought he needed you for our big plan and disappointed now that he
      can't include you in it&mdash;because you could help us and we could
      perhaps help you. Yes, disappointed&mdash;in spite of&mdash;and&mdash;and
      don't forget the other thing I said, that those of us that believe in
      truth in the theater owe it to our faith to get to work on the men that
      supply the plays.... Can't you see, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her arms again. His eyes, something of the heady spirits
      that she would perhaps have called sex attraction shining in them now,
      could see little more than those arms, the slim curves of her body in the
      sweater and short skirt, her eager glowing face and fine eyes. And his
      mind could see no more than his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An automobile horn sounded. He caught her arm and hurried her to the
      roadside. There were more of the large bare trees here; and a rail fence
      by which they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say Zanin has given up the idea of coming to me with his plan?&rdquo; He
      spoke guardedly, thinking that he must not betray the confidences of Betty
      and Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has had to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke to me about it, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. But the man that is going to back him wants to do that part
      of it himself or have his own director do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pictures unreeled suddenly before his mind's eye&mdash;Sue, in &ldquo;a pretty
      primitive costume,&rdquo; exploited at once by the egotistical self-seeking
      Zanin, the unscrupulous, masterful Silverstone, a temperamental,
      commercial director! He shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he began&mdash;he would fall back on his age and position; he
      would control this little situation, not drift through it!&mdash;&ldquo;you
      mentioned my experience. Well, you're right. I've seen these Broadway
      managers with their coats off. And I've seen what happens to enthusiastic
      girls that fall into their hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; that miserable letter flashed on his brain. He could fairly
      see it. And then his tongue ran wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know that Broadway is paved with the skulls of enthusiastic
      girls!... Silverstone? Why, if I were to give you a tenth of Silverstone's
      history you would shrink from him&mdash;you wouldn't touch the man's ugly
      hand. Here you are, young, attractive&mdash;yes, beautiful, in your own
      strange way!&mdash;full of a real faith in what you call the truth, on the
      edge of giving up your youth and your gifts into the hands of a bunch of
      Broadway crooks. You talk about me and the Broadway Thing. Good God, can't
      you see that it's girls like you that make the Broadway Thing possible!...
      You talk of my sentimentality about women, my 'home-and-mother-stuff,'
      can't you see the reason for that home-and-mother stuff, for that
      sentimentality, is the tens of thousands of girls, like you and unlike you
      who wanted to experiment, who thought they could make the world what they
      wanted it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to breathe. The girl before him was distinctly flushed now, and
      was facing him with wide eyes&mdash;hard eyes, he thought. He had poured
      out a flood of feeling, and it had left her cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning back against the fence, her arms extended along the top
      rail, looking and looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silverstone!&rdquo; he snorted, unable to keep silence &ldquo;Silverstone! The man's
      a crook, I tell you. Nothing that he wants gets away from him. Understand
      me? Nothing! You people will be children beside him.... Zanin is bad
      enough. He's smart! He'll wait you out! He doesn't believe in marriage, he
      doesn't! But Zanin&mdash;why, Silverstone'll play with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were still on him&mdash;wide and cold. Now her lips parted, and
      she drew in a quick breath, &ldquo;How on earth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you learn all
      this! Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut his lips close together. Plainly he had broken; he had gone wild,
      cleared the traces. Staring at her, at that sweater, he tried to think....
      She would upbraid Betty. How would he ever square things with Hy!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her hands grip the fence rail so tightly that her finger-tips went
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said again, with deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;where you learned
      these things. Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt rather than saw the movement of her body within the sweater as she
      breathed with a slow inhalation. His own breath came quickly. His throat
      was suddenly dry. He swallowed&mdash;once, twice. Then he stepped forward
      and laid his hand, a trembling hard, on her forearm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook it off and sprang back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at me like that!&rdquo; his voice said. And rushed on: &ldquo;Can't you
      see that I'm pleading for your very life! Can't you see that I <i>know</i>
      what you are headed for&mdash;that I want to save you from yourself&mdash;that
      I love you&mdash;that I'm offering you my life&mdash;that I want to take
      you out of this crazy atmosphere of the Village and give...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, partly because he was out of breath, and felt, besides, as if
      his tonsils had abruptly swollen and filled his throat; partly because she
      turned deliberately away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, uneasily leaning against the fence while she walked off a
      little way, very slowly; stood thinking; then came back. She looked rather
      white now, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we drop this and finish our walk. It's a good three
      hours yet over to the other railroad. We may as well make a job of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sue,&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;how can you!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away. &ldquo;I simply can not keep up this personal talk. I would be
      glad to finish the walk with you, but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled himself together amid the wreckage of his thoughts and feelings.
      &ldquo;But if I won't or can't, you'll have to walk alone,&rdquo; he said for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did mean that. I am sorry. I did hope it would be possible.&rdquo; She
      compressed her lips, then added: &ldquo;Of course I should have seen that it
      wasn't possible, after what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, silent, past the woods, past more plowed fields, up
      another hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the silence. Gravely, she said: &ldquo;I will say just one thing more,
      since you already know so much. Zarin signs up with Silverstone to-morrow
      morning. Or as soon as they can finish drawing up the contracts. Then
      within one or two weeks&mdash;very soon, certainly&mdash;we go down to
      Cuba or Florida to begin taking the outdoor scenes. That, you see, settles
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's mind blurred again. Ugly foggy thoughts rushed over it. He stopped
      short, his long gloomy face workhing nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;You mean to say&mdash;you're going to let those
      crooks take you off&mdash;to Cuba! Don't you see...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no object in saying more. Even Peter could see that. For Sue,
      after one brief look at his sputtering, distorted face, had turned away
      and was now walking swiftly on up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Sue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached the top of the hill, passed on over the crest. Gradually she
      disappeared down the farther slope&mdash;the tam o'shanter last.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE NATURE FILM PRODUCING CO. INC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEN Peter,
      muttering, talking out loud to the road, the fence, the trees, the sky,
      turned back to retrace the miles they had covered so lightly and rapidly.
      His feet and legs hurt him cruelly. He found a rough stick, broke it over
      a rock and used it for a cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of joining Hy and Betty. There would be sympathy there,
      perhaps. Hy could do something. Hy would have to do something. Where were
      they, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he caught a glimpse of them. They were sitting on a
      boulder on a grassy hillside, some little distance from the road. They
      appeared to be gazing dreamily off across a valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hesitated. They were very close together. They hardly seemed to
      invite interruption. Then, while he stood, dusty and bedraggled, in real
      pain, watching them, he saw Betty lean back against the boulder&mdash;or
      was it against Hy's arm?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy seemed to be leaning over her. His head bent lower still. It quite hid
      hers from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was kissing her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Blind to the shooting pains in his feet and legs, Peter rushed, stumbling,
      away. In his profound self-pity, he felt that even Hy had deserted him. He
      was alone, in a world that had no motive or thought but to do him evil, to
      pervert his finest motives, to crush him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow he got back to that railroad. An hour and a half he spent
      painfully sitting in the country station waiting for a train. There was
      time to think. There was time for nothing but thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Peter, as so often when deeply stirred either by joy or misery, found
      himself passing into a violent and soul-wrenching reaction. It was misery
      this time. He was a crawling abject thing. People would laugh. Sue would
      laugh...
    </p>
    <p>
      But would she! Would she tell? Would Hy and Betty, if they ever did get
      home, know that she had returned alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those deep-green eyes of hers, the strong little chin.... She was Miss
      Independence herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin was signing with Silverstone in the morning! Or as soon as the
      contracts could be drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train came rumbling in. Peter, in, physical and spiritual agony,
      boarded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these painful, exciting experiences of the day were drawing together
      toward some new unexpected result. He was beaten&mdash;yet was he beaten!
      A news agent walked through the train with a great pile of magazines on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter suddenly thought of the moving-picture periodical he had dropped, so
      long, long ago, in the Tunnel Station. He bought another copy; and again
      turned the pages. Then he let it fall to his knees and stared out the
      window with eyes that saw little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin&mdash;Silverstone&mdash;Sue walking alone over a hill!... Peters
      little lamp of genius was burning once more. He was thrilled, if
      frightened, by the ideas that were forming in that curious mind of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after seven o'clock of the same evening Jacob Zanin reached his
      mean little room in Fourth Street, after a stirring twenty-four hours at
      Silver-stone's house at Long Beach and an ineffectual attempt to find Sue
      in her rooms. Those rooms were dim and silent. No one answered his ring.
      No one answered his knock when he finally succeeded in following another
      tenant of the building into the inner hall. Which explains why he was at
      his room, alone, at a quarter to eight when Peter Ericson Mann called
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, pale, nerves tense, a feverish glow in his eyes behind the
      horn-rimmed glasses, leaned heavily on a walking stick in the dark
      hallway, listening to the sound of heavy footsteps coming across the
      creaking boards on the other side of the door. Then the door opened; and
      Zanin, coatless, collarless, hair rumpled over his ears on either side of
      his head, stood there; a hulking figure of a man, full of force, not
      untouched with inner fire; a little grim; his face, that of a vigorously
      intellectual Russian peasant, scarred perceptibly by racial and personal
      hardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hello, Mann!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Then, observing the stick: &ldquo;What's
      the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little arch trouble. Nothing at all.&rdquo; And Peter limped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, as on former occasions, felt the power of the fellow. It was
      altogether in character that he should exhibit no surprise, though Peter
      Ericson Mann had never before appeared before him at that door. (He would
      never know that it was Peter's seventh call within an hour and a half.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was at his calmest and most effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked casually about at the scant furniture, the soap boxes heaped
      with books, the kerosene stove, symbol of Zanin's martyrdom to his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two things stuck in my mind the other night when you
      and I had our little talk. One was the fact that you had got hold of a big
      idea; and that a man of your caliber wouldn't be giving his time to a
      proposition that didn't have something vital in it.... The other thing is
      Sue Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin was tipped back in an armless wooden chair, taking Peter in with
      eyes that were shrewd and cold, but not particularly hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't realize at the time what an impression that girl was making on
      me. But I haven't been able to shake it off. She has something distinctly
      unusual&mdash;call it beauty, charm, personally&mdash;I don't know what it
      is. But she has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Zanin, &ldquo;she has it. But see here, Mann, the whole situation
      has changed since then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Peter broke in. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded, offhand. &ldquo;Betty Deane has talked to Hy Lowe about it, and Hy
      has told me. I'm pretty well informed, as a matter of fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silverstone? Yes. Tell me, have you closed with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Zanin hesitated.. He was disturbed. &ldquo;Not in writing, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you do it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin pursed his lips, hooked his feet around the legs of his chair and
      tapped on the front of the seat with his large fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's regular money, Mann,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you could interest me. Why don't you try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular money is regular money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you don't get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Silverstone will. And look what he'll do to your ideas&mdash;a
      conventional commercialist!&rdquo; Zanin considered this. &ldquo;I've got to risk
      that. Or it looks so. This thing can't possibly be done cheap. I propose
      to do something really new in a feature film&mdash;new in groupings, new
      in lighting, new in the simplicity and naturalness of the acting. It will
      be a daring theme, highly controversial, which means building up
      publicity. It will take regular money. Sue is in just the right frame of
      mind. A year from now God knows what she'll be thinking and feeling. She
      might turn square against our Village life, all of a sudden. I've seen it
      happen.... And now, with everything right, here the money comes to me on a
      platter. Lord, man, I've got to take it&mdash;risk or no risk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were about to come to grips. Peter felt his skin turning cold. His
      throat went dry again, as in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much&rdquo;&mdash;he asked, outwardly firmer than he would have dared hope&mdash;&ldquo;how
      much do you need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin really started now, and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've gone pretty far in with Silver stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't signed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor taken his money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed shortly. &ldquo;Do you think <i>he</i> would consider himself
      bound by anything you may have said! Silverstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a point. He could see Zanin thinking it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you need?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think will happen the minute Sue really discovers the sort of
      hands she's in? Even if she would want to stick to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was another point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;said Zanin, thinking fast&mdash;&ldquo;it needn't be lavish, like
      these big battle films and such. But it will take money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four thousand. Maybe five or six. It means going south for the
      outdoor scenes. I want tropical foliage, so my people won't look frozen.
      And publicity isn't cheap, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gulped; but plunged on. &ldquo;I'll tell you what you do, Zanin. Get
      another man&mdash;a littler producer than Silverstone&mdash;and have him
      supply studio, operators, and all the plant necessary, on a partnership
      basis, you to put in some part of the cash needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; said Zanin. &ldquo;Fine! And where's the cash to come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The front legs of Zanin's chair came to the floor with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is new stuff, Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New stuff. I'm not rich, but I believe you've got a big thing here, and I
      stand willing to put up a few thousand on a private contract with you.
      This can be just between ourselves. All I ask is a reasonable control of
      the expenditure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin thought&mdash;and thought. Peter could see the shifting lights in
      his cold clear eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved over to the window and stared out into the area-way, where
      electric lamps and gas flames twinkled from a hundred other rear
      buildings. He came back to his chair and lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on!&rdquo; he finally said. &ldquo;If you want to know, I <i>am</i> worried
      about Silverstone. And I'm certainly in no position to turn down such an
      offer as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was the genesis of The Nature Film Producing Co., Inc., Jacob Zanin,
      Pres't. They talked late, these new partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly one o'clock in the morning when Peter limped into the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Hy pitting by the window in his pajamas, gazing rapturously at a
      lacy handerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Hy, &ldquo;he comes! Never mind the hour, my boy! I take off my hat.
      You're better than I am&mdash;better than I! A <i>soupçon</i> of speed,
      ol' dear!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter dropped limply into the Morris chair. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said Hy,
      observing him more closely. &ldquo;You look done. Where's Sue?&rdquo; Peter composed
      himself. &ldquo;I left Sue a long while ago. Hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I promised you I'd do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a new, an impressive Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't get you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said Sue might not listen to my warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;and she didn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;oh, you said you'd go to Zanin...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As man to man, Hy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lord, you haven't... Pete, you're limping! You didn't fight!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter solemnly shook his head. &ldquo;It wasn't necessary, Hy,&rdquo; he said huskily;
      then cleared his throat. &ldquo;What was the matter with his throat to-day,
      anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back in his chair. His eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy leaned forward with some anxiety. &ldquo;Pete, what's the matter? You're
      white!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's head moved slowly. &ldquo;Nothing's the matter.&rdquo; He slowly opened his
      eyes. &ldquo;It has been a hard day, Hy, but the job is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The job...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved her, Hy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be taken under my direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Silverstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silverstone is out. I control the company.&rdquo; He closed his eyes again and
      breathed slowly and evenly in a deliberate effort to calm his tumultuous
      nerves. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Hy, big-eyed. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something to drink, Hy,&rdquo; Peter murmured. &ldquo;I put it over, Hy! I put it
      over!&rdquo; He said this with a little more vigor, trying to talk down certain
      sudden misgivings regarding six thin little books with pasteboard covers
      that lay at the moment in the middle drawer of the desk, next the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy got slowly to his feet; stood rubbing his head and staring down in
      complete admiration at the apparently triumphant if unmistakably exhausted
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a queer time for them,&rdquo; Hy remarked, solemn himself now. &ldquo;But in
      this case cocktails are certainly indicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the telephone. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; he said to the night man below, &ldquo;some
      ice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he shuffled to the closet, struck a match and found the shaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the amber fluid they pledged the success of The Nature Film Producing
      Co., Inc., these Seventh-Story Men! Dwelling, the while, each in his own
      thoughts, on the essential nobility of sacrificing one's self to save
      another.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;PETER THE MAGNIFICENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F she strikes you
      as a girl you'd like to kiss, I should say, as a general principle&mdash;well,
      kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Hy Lowe, musingly, seated on the decrepit flat-top desk between the
      two windows of the studio, swinging his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ericson Mann met this observation with contempt. &ldquo;Right off, I
      suppose! First time you meet her&mdash;just like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expert waved his cigarette. &ldquo;Sure. Kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She murmurs her thanks, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She hates you. Won't ever speak to you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo; Peter was caustic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't think you were that sort; and won't for a minute permit you to
      think she's that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another wave of the cigarette. &ldquo;Slow down. Be kind to her. If she's a
      cross old thing, forgive her. Let her see that you're a regular fellow,
      even if you did start from third base instead of first. Above all, keep
      cool. Avoid tragedy, scenes. Keep smiling. When she does swing round&mdash;well,
      you've kissed her. There you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter surveyed his apartment mate with gloomy eyes. &ldquo;Sue and Betty are two
      very different girls,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied Hy, &ldquo;I am not discussing persons. I am enunciating a
      principle. What may have passed between friend Betty and me has nothing to
      do with it.&rdquo; He glanced at his watch. &ldquo;Though I'll admit she is expecting
      me around this evening. She doesn't hate me, Pete.... Funny thing about
      Betty&mdash;she was telling me&mdash;there's a man up in her town
      pestering her to death. Letters and telegrams. Wants to marry her. He
      makes gas engines. Queer about these small-town fellows&mdash;they can't
      understand a free-spirited woman. Imagine Betty cooped up like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not likely to be kissing Sue,&rdquo; growled Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, you've as good as done it already. From your own admission. Asked
      her to marry you. Right off, too&mdash;just like that! Can't you see it's
      the same thing in principle&mdash;shock and reaction! She'd have preferred
      the kiss of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you, Pete, is that you don't understand women. According
      to your own story again, you startled her so that she left you on a
      country road and walked ten miles alone rather than answer you. I tell
      you, get a woman real angry at you just once, and she can't be indifferent
      to you as long as she lives. Hate you&mdash;yes. Love you&mdash;yes.
      Indifferent&mdash;no.... You've started something. Give her time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; snorted Peter. &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; He paced the long room; kicked the closet
      door shut; gave the piano keys a savage bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy watched Peter with growing concern. His eyes roved about the
      smoke-dimmed, high-ceiled studio. They had lived well here&mdash;himself,
      Peter and the Worm. Thanks to some unknown law of personality, they had
      got on, this odd trio, through the years. Girls and women had drifted into
      and out of their individual lives (for your New York bachelor does not
      inhabit a vacuum)&mdash;but never before had the specter of marriage
      stalked with disruptive import through these dingy rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pete,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why be so dam' serious about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter paused in his pacing and stared at Hy.... &ldquo;Serious!&rdquo; He repeated the
      word under his breath. His long face worked convulsively behind the large
      horn-rimmed glasses (not spectacles) and their black ribbon. Then abruptly
      he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy sighed, glanced out at the weather (it was April), picked up hat, stick
      and gloves and sauntered forth to dine comfortably at his club as a
      ritualistic preliminary to a pleasant evening. That, he thought now, was
      the great thing about bachelor life in town. You had all the advantages of
      feminine companionship&mdash;in assorted varieties&mdash;and then when you
      preferred or if the ladies bored you you just went to the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat on the edge of the bed, all nerves, and thought about Sue Wilde.
      Also about six little bank books.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been his secret inner life, the bank books locked away in the
      middle drawer of the desk on the side next the wall. Nearly seven thousand
      dollars were now entered in those books&mdash;Peter's all. He was staking
      it on a single throw. He had rushed in where a shrewder theatrical angel
      might well have feared to tread. It was the wild outbreak of a cautious
      impractical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it all over, sitting there on the edge of the bed. It was
      terrifying, but stirring. In his plays some one was always saving a girl
      through an act of personal sacrifice. Now he was acting it out in life.
      Indicating the truth to life of his plays.... He was risking all. But so
      had Napoleon, returning from Elba, risked all (he did not pursue the
      analogy). So had Henry V at Agincourt. After all, considered in this
      light, it was rather fine. Certain persons would admire him if they knew.
      It was the way big men did things. He was glad that Sue didn't know; it
      was finer to take the plunge without so much as asking a return. It was
      magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word, popping into his thoughts, gave Peter a thrill. Yes, it was
      magnificent. He was doing a magnificent thing. All that remained was to
      carry it off magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged his trunk from the closet. The lower tray and the bottom were
      packed with photographs and with letters tied in flat bundles&mdash;letters
      in various feminine hands. He stirred the bundles about. Some were old&mdash;years
      old; others less so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter regarded them with the detachment of exaltation. They could not
      possibly mean anything to him; his life had begun the day he first saw Sue
      Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried them into the studio, great armsful, and piled them about the
      hearth. In the bottom drawer of the bureau were other packets of intimate
      documents. He brought those as well. Then he set to work to burn, packet
      by packet, that curiously remote past life of his. And he smiled a little
      at this memory and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely packed papers do not burn easily. He was seated there on the floor
      before the fireplace, stirring up sheets at which the flames had nibbled,
      when Jacob Zanin came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin stared and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad as that?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter met this sally with dignified silence. He urged his caller to sit
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin dropped his hat on the desk and disposed his big frame in the Morris
      chair. His coat was wrinkled, his trousers baggy. Under his coat was an
      old gray sweater. The head above the sweater collar was big and
      well-poised. The face was hard and strong; the eyes were alight with
      restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm dog tired,&rdquo; said Zanin. &ldquo;Been rehearsing six hours straight.&rdquo; And he
      added: &ldquo;I suppose you haven't had a chance to go over my scenario.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done more than that,&rdquo; replied Peter calmly; &ldquo;I've written a new
      one.&rdquo; And as Zanin's brows came down questioningly he added: &ldquo;I think
      you'll find I've pointed up your ideas. The thing was very strong. Once I
      got to thinking about it I couldn't let go. What it needed was clarifying
      and rearranging and building for climaxes. That's what makes it so hard
      for our people to understand you Russians&mdash;you are formless,
      chaotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like life,&rdquo; said Zanin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But not like our stage traditions. You wanted me to help you
      reach a popular audience. That's what I'm trying to do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Zanin doubtfully. &ldquo;Let me take it along. I'll read it
      to-night&mdash;go over it with Sue, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll have to see it, Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll read it to you&mdash;to you and Sue,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin looked at him, faintly surprised and thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter went back to the hearth, dropped on his knees and threw another
      bundle of letters into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Zanin, hesitating, &ldquo;I had some work planned for Sue
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; remarked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but there is.&rdquo; Zanin hitched forward in his chair. The eager hardness
      came again into his eyes. His strong, slightly husky voice rose a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? How so?&rdquo; Peter settled back on his heels and poked the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mann&mdash;everything's just right for us now. I've interested
      the Interstellar people&mdash;-that's partly what I came to say&mdash;they'll
      supply studio stuff for the interior scenes and a camera man. Also they'll
      stand a third of the expense. They're ready to sign whenever you are. And
      what's more important&mdash;well, here's the question of Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's delicate&mdash;but I'll be frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be. You and I are going into this as business men, Zanin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. As business men. Well&mdash;Sue's a girl, after all. In this
      thing we are staking a lot on her interest and enthusiasm&mdash;pretty
      nearly everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's ready&mdash;eager. I know her pretty thoroughly, Mann. I've
      studied her. We have no real hold on her. She isn't a professional
      actress, to be hired at so much a week. Her only reason for going into it
      at all, is that she believes, with you and me, that the thing ought to be
      done. Now that's all right. It's fine! But it's going to take delicate
      handling. A girl acts as she feels, you know. Right now Sue feels like
      doing my Nature film with all her might.&rdquo; He spread out his hands. In his
      eyes was an eager appeal. &ldquo;God, Maun, that's all we've got! Don't you see?
      Just Sue's feelings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Peter replied. He threw the last heap of photographs on the fire.
      &ldquo;But what was the frank thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin hesitated; drummed nervously on the chair-arm. &ldquo;I'm coming to that.
      It's a bit awkward, Mann. It's&mdash;well, I am more or less in Sue's
      confidence, you know. I'm with her so much, I can sense her moods.... The
      fact is, Mann, if you'll let me say so, you don't seem to understand
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've been told,&rdquo; remarked Peter dryly. &ldquo;Go on with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sue's got it into her head that you don't get the idea of
      intelligent radicalism. That you're...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I'm a reactionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that you're a reactionary. She's worried about the scenario&mdash;afraid
      you'll miss the very point of it.&rdquo; Again he spread out his large strong
      hands. &ldquo;So don't you see why I'm eager to get hold of it and read it to
      her&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated again, and knit his brows&mdash;&ldquo;so I can reassure
      her... You see, Mann, Sue just doesn't like you. That's the plain fact.
      You've hit her all wrong.&rdquo; He raised a hand to ward off Peter's
      interruption. &ldquo;Oh, we'll straighten that out all right! But it'll take
      delicate handling&mdash;just now, while we're working out the scenario and
      planning the trip south&mdash;and so, meantime...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like me to keep out of Sue's way as much as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave everything to me, Mann. As it stands now, here she is, keen,
      all ready, once she's solid in her mind about the right spirit of the
      scenario, to start south with me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter waved the poker in a series of small circles and figure eights; then
      held it motionless and sighted along it with squinted-up eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why go south?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin gave a start and stared at him; then controlled himself, for the
      expenses of that little trip, two-thirds of them, at least, must be paid
      out of the funds entered in Peter's six little bank books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why go south?&rdquo; Zanin repeated, gropingly; then came back at Peter with a
      rush of words. &ldquo;Good lord, Mann, don't you see that we're putting over a
      big piece of symbolism&mdash;the most delicate and difficult job on earth.
      This isn't <i>Shore Acres!</i> It isn't the <i>Doll's House!</i> It's a
      realized dream, and it's got to be put across with such quality and power
      that it will fire a new dream in the public mind. I propose to spring
      right out at 'em, startle 'em&mdash;yes, shock 'em; and all the time keep
      it where they can't lay their vulgar hands on it. We can't show our Nature
      effects&mdash;primitive, half-nude people&mdash;against a background of a
      New Jersey farm land with a chestnut tree and a couple of oaks in the
      middle distance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty fine trees, those!&rdquo; observed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a minute!&rdquo; Zanin sprang to his feet; his voice rang. &ldquo;Got to be
      remote, exotic&mdash;dream quality, fantasy all through. Florida or
      California&mdash;palm trees and such. Damn it, the thing's a poem! It's
      got to be done as a poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode down the room and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter got up, very calm, rather white about the mouth and watched him....
      Dream quality? His thoughts were woven through and through with it at this
      moment. A voice at his inner ear, a voice curiously like Hy's, was
      murmuring over and over: &ldquo;Sure! Kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see?&rdquo; cried Zanin, confronting him, and spreading out those big
      hands. Peter wished wildly that he would keep them in his pockets, put
      them behind his back&mdash;anything to get them out of sight!... &ldquo;Lets be
      sensible, Maun. As you said, we're business men, you and I. You let me
      take the scenario. I'm to see Sue this evening&mdash;I'll read it to her.
      I'm sure it's good. It'll reassure her. And it will help me to hold her
      enthusiasm and pave the way for a better understanding between her and
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite unforeseen by either, the little matter of reading the scenario had
      struck up an issue between them. All was not harmony within the
      directorate of The Nature Film Producing Co., Inc., Jacob Zanin, Pres't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I won't let you have it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;good lord!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Magnificent was the word. Zanin gulped down a temperamental explosion and
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, as he came slowly back from the elevator to the apartment,
      discovered that he still held the poker tightly in his right hand, like a
      sword. He thought again of Napoleon and Henry V.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless, by the window, staring out; moved by the histrionic
      emotionalism that was almost his soul to stiffen his shoulders like a
      king's. Out there&mdash;beyond old Washington Square where the first buds
      of spring tipped the trees&mdash;beyond the glimpse, down a red-brick
      vista of the Sixth Avenue Elevated&mdash;still beyond and on, were, he
      knew, the dusty wandering streets, the crumbling houses with pasts, the
      flimsy apartment buildings decorated in front with rococo fire escapes,
      the bleak little three-cornered parks, the devastating subway excavations
      of Greenwich Village. Somewhere in that welter of poverty and art, at this
      very moment (unless she had walked up-town) was Sue Wilde. He tried to
      imagine just where. Perhaps in the dim little rear apartment she shared
      with Betty Deane, waiting for Zarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze wandered down to the Square. There was Zanin, crossing it, under
      the bare trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grip on the poker relaxed. He moved toward the telephone; glanced out
      again at the swift-striding Zanin; then with dignity, replaced the poker
      by the fireplace, consulted the telephone book and called up Sue's
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue herself answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Eric Mann,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I want very much to talk with you&rdquo;&mdash;his
      voice was none too steady&mdash;&ldquo;about the scenario.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;over the wire he could feel her hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;if it is
      important....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time, almost, then...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you busy now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd dine with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;all right. At Jim's, say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color came rushing to Peter's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away?&rdquo; he suggested, controlling his voice. &ldquo;All right. I'll meet
      you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hung up the receiver and smiled. So Zanin was to see Sue this
      evening, was he? &ldquo;He'll need a telescope,&rdquo; mused Peter with savage joy as
      he hurried out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;PROPINQUITY-PLUS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E caught up with
      her at the corner nearest Jim's&mdash;the same Sue he had first met, here
      in the Village, on a curbstone, eating an apple&mdash;wearing her old tarn
      o'shanter; good shoulders, no hips, well-shaped hands and feet; odd,
      honest deep-green eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a wreck from endless rehearsing she told him smilingly and ordered
      a big English chop and a bigger baked potato. These were good at Jim's.
      She ate them like a hungry boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered her with inner hesitation, a cigarette. She shook her head.
      &ldquo;Zanin won't let me,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;He says it's going to be a big hard
      job, coming right on top of all the work at the Crossroads, and I must
      keep fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin! Zanin!...&rdquo; But Peter maintained his studied calm. &ldquo;I've got the
      scenario in my pocket,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I want to read it to you. And if
      you don't mind I'll tell you just why I want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't mind,&rdquo; said she, with just one half-covert glance.
      &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please hear me out,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lids did droop a little now. This was the Eric Mann whose plays she
      had seen in past years and who had pounced on her so suddenly with a crazy
      avowal of love.... A man she hardly knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quietly now and patiently; even with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;you and Zanin and I&mdash;are starting a serious job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I began all wrong by taking a personal attitude toward you, and we
      quarreled rather absurdly...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't speak of that,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to this extent: Any little personal misunderstandings&mdash;well,
      we've got to be businesslike and frank.... I'll tell you. This afternoon&mdash;just
      now, in fact&mdash;when I suggested to Zanin that I read it to the two of
      you, he objected. In fact he told me in so many words that you disliked me
      and didn't trust my understanding and that it would be necessary for him
      to act as a buffer between you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she quickly, &ldquo;that's absurd, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He rather insisted on taking the scenario and reading it to
      you himself. Now that won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care who reads it to me,&rdquo; said Sue coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Now, if you'll agree with me that there's nothing personal
      between us, that we're just whole-hearted workmen on a job, I...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows a little, waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...I came here with the idea of asking you to hunt Zanin up with me&mdash;making
      it a matter of company business, right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, her independent spirt stirred, &ldquo;I don't see that that's
      necessary. Why don't you go ahead&mdash;just read it to me?&rdquo; She looked
      about the smoky busy room. &ldquo;But it's noisy here. And people you know come
      in and want to talk. I'd ask you around to the rooms, only...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, Hy Lowe will be there.&rdquo; Peter, feeling new ground under his feet,
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue smiled a little herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your place?&rdquo; she asked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question took Peter's breath. She said it in unmistakable good faith,
      like a man. But never, never, in Peter's whole adult life, had a woman
      said such a thing to him. That women came occasionally; into the old
      bachelor apartment building, he knew. But the implications! What would
      Hamer-ton, across the hall, think of him were he to meet them together in
      the elevator? What would John the night man think? Above all (this thought
      came second) what would they think of Sue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; observed Sue, with real good humor, &ldquo;I remember! That's the building
      where women callers can't stay after eleven at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nearly succeeded in fighting back the flush that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; Sue continued, &ldquo;has always seemed to me the final comment on
      conventional morality. It's the best bit of perfectly unconscious humor in
      New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was thinking&mdash;in flashes and leaps, like Napoleon&mdash;startled
      by his own daring, yet athrill with new determination. The Worm was out of
      town; Hy very much engaged.... Besides, Sue was honest and right. This was
      the sincere note in the New Russianism. Being yourself, straight-out. He
      must rise to it, now or never, if he was not to lose Sue for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he smiled. &ldquo;It's only eight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can read you the whole thing
      and we can discuss it within a couple of hours. And we won't be
      interrupted there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking straight into that building with Sue at his side, nodding with his
      usual casual friendliness to John the night man, chatting while the
      elevator crawled endlessly upward to the seventh floor, overcoming the
      impulse to run past the doors of the other apartments, carrying it all off
      with easy sophistication; this was unquestionably the bravest single act
      in the whole life of Peter Ericson Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter could be a pleasant host. He lighted the old gas-burning student
      lamp on the desk; started a fire; threw all the cushions in one large pile
      on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue threw aside her coat and tarn o'shanter, smoothed her hair a little,
      then curled up on the couch with her feet under her where she could watch
      the fire; and where (as it happened) the firelight played softly on her
      alert face. She filled the dingy old room with a new and very human
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter settled back in the Morris chair and after one long look at her
      plunged with a sudden fever of energy into the reading of the scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the thing Peter did best. He read rapidly; moved forward in his
      chair and gestured now and then for emphasis with his long hands; threw
      more than a little sense of movement and power into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue listened rather idly at first; then, as Peter's trained, nicely
      modulated voice swept on, lifted her head, leaned forward, watched his
      face. Peter felt her gaze but dared not return it. Once he stopped,
      flushed and hoarse, and telephoned down for ice-water. Those eyes, all
      alight, followed him as he rushed past her to the door and returned with
      the clinking water pitcher. He snatched up the manuscript and finished it&mdash;nearly
      half an hour of it&mdash;standing. Then he threw it on the desk with a
      noise that made Sue jump, and himself strode to the fireplace and stood
      there, mopping his face, still avoiding her eyes. She was still leaning
      eagerly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he now, with a rather weak effort at casualness, &ldquo;what do you
      think of it? Of course it's a rough draft&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is no such thing,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up; moved to the table: took up the manuscript and turned the
      first pages. Then she came to the other side of the hearth with it, &ldquo;What
      I want to know is&mdash;How did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's Zanin's ideas, of course; but they needed rearranging and
      pointing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't a rearrangement,&rdquo; said she; and now he awoke to consciousness
      of the suppressed stirring quality in her voice, a quality he had not
      heard in it before. &ldquo;It isn't a rearrangement. It's a created thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you really think that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It carries the big idea. It's the very spirit of freedom. It's a&mdash;a
      sort of battle-cry&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;Of course it
      isn't that, exactly; it's really a big vital drama. I'm talking rather
      wildly. But&mdash;&rdquo; She confronted him; he looked past her hair at the
      wall. She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Don't make me go on saying these inane
      things, please! You know as well as I do what you've done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've stated our faith with a force and a fineness that Zanin, even,
      could never get. You've said it all for us.... Oh, I owe you an apology!
      Zanin told you part of the truth. I didn't dream&mdash;from your plays and
      things you have said&mdash;that you could do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at her now with breathless solemnity. &ldquo;I've changed,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not ashamed of changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or of growing, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But listen! You don't know what you've done.
      Do you suppose I've been looking forward to this job&mdash;making myself
      sensationally conspicuous, working with commercial-minded people? Oh, how
      I've dreaded that side of it! And worrying all the time because the
      scenario wasn't good. It just wasn't. It wasn't real people, feeling and
      living; it was ideas&mdash;nothing but ideas&mdash;stalking around. That's
      Zanin, of course. He's a big man, he has got the ideas, but he hasn't got
      <i>people</i>, quite; he just doesn't understand women,... Don't you see,&rdquo;
       she threw out her hands&mdash;&ldquo;the only reason, the only excuse, really,
      for going through with this ordeal is to help make people everywhere
      understand Truth. And I've known&mdash;it's been discouraging&mdash;that
      we couldn't possibly do that unless it was clearly expressed for us....
      Now do you see what you've done? It's <i>that!</i> And it's pretty
      exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin may not take it this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he will! He'll have to. It means so much to him. That man has lost
      everything at the Crossroads, you know. And now he is staking all he has
      left&mdash;his intelligence, his strength, his courage, on this. It means
      literally everything to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared at her. &ldquo;And what do you suppose it means to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I don't know, of course...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter strode to the desk, unlocked the middle drawer next the wall, drew
      out the six little bank books, and almost threw them into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at those,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;all of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go through them, please! Add them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half smiling, she did so. Then said: &ldquo;It seems to come to almost seven
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the money that's going to work out your dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at him, then down at the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all I've got in the world&mdash;all&mdash;all! That, and the three
      per cent, it brings in. My play&mdash;they're going to produce it in the
      fall. You won't like it. It's the old ideas, the old Broadway stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Since I wrote it. It doesn't matter. It may bring money, it may not.
      Likely not. Ninety per cent, of 'em fail, you know. This is all I've got&mdash;every
      cent All my energy and what courage I've got goes after it&mdash;into The
      Nature Film Producing Company. Please understand that! I'm leading up to
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked a thought disturbed. He rushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin's got it into his head that he's going to take you south to do all
      the outdoor scenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't agreed to that. He feels that it's necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does. He's sincere enough. Remember, I'm talking impersonally. As
      I told you, we've got to be businesslike&mdash;and frank. We've got to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm beginning to see that Zanin is just as much of a hero with other
      people's money as he is with his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That goes with the temperament, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. But now, see! That trip south&mdash;taking actors and camera
      man and outfit&mdash;staying around at hotels&mdash;railway fares&mdash;it
      will cost a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, very grave, &ldquo;I hadn't realized that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can just keep our heads&mdash;-more carefully&mdash;spend the money
      where it will really show on the film&mdash;don't you see, we can swing
      it, and when we've done it, it won't belong to the Interstellar people&mdash;or
      to Silverstone; it'll be ours. And that means it'll be what we&mdash;you&mdash;want
      it to be and not something vulgar and&mdash;and nasty. The other way, it
      we give Zanin his head and begin spending money magnificently, we'll run
      out, and then the price of a little more money, if we can get it at all,
      will be, the control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Re reached down for the books, threw them back into the drawer, slammed it
      and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's all I've got. I pledge it all, here and now, to
      the dream you've dreamed. All I ask is, keep in mind what may happen when
      it's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose now; stood thinking; then drew on her lam o'shanter and reached
      for her coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think this over,&rdquo; she said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be businesslike,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Impersonal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, and stepped over to the fire, low-burning now with a mass
      of red coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's eyes, deep, gloomy behind the big glasses, followed her. He came
      slowly and stood by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;It'll he eleven first thing we known It
      would be a bit too amusing to be put out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Peter found himself lifting his arms. He tried to keep them down, but
      up, up they came&mdash;very slowly, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her shoulders, swung her around, drew her close. It seemed to
      him afterward, during one of the thousand efforts he made to construct a
      mental picture of the scene, that she must have been resisting him and
      that he must have been using his strength; but if this was so it made no
      difference. Her head was in the hollow' of his arm. He bent down, drew her
      head up, kissed, as it happened, her nose; forced her face about and at
      the second effort kissed her lips. If she was struggling&mdash;and Peter
      will never be quite clear on that point&mdash;she was unable to resist
      him. He kissed her again. And then again. A triumphant fury was upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly it passed. He almost pushed her away from him; left her
      standing, limp and breathless, by the mantel, while he threw himself on
      the couch and plunged his face into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll hate me,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;You won't ever speak to me again. You'll
      think I'm that sort of man, and you'll be right in thinking so. What's
      worse, you'll believe I thought you were the sort to let me do it. And all
      the time I love you more than&mdash;Oh God, what made me do it! What could
      I have been thinking of! I was mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the room was still.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE MOMENT AFTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER tried to
      think. He could not lie there indefinitely with his face in his hands. But
      he couldn't think. His mind had stopped running.... At last he must face
      her. He remembered Napoleon. Slowly he lifted his head; got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself on an arm of the Morris chair, taken off her tarn
      o'shanter and was running her fingers through her rumpled short hair. She
      did not look at him. After a moment she put the tam o'shanter on again,
      but did not instantly get up; instead, reached out and drew the manuscript
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stood over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any good saying I'm sorry,&rdquo; he began... &ldquo;Please don't talk about
      it,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Peter, helpless, tried and tried to think.... hy
      had brought him to this. In his heart he cursed Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been thinking,&rdquo; said Sue, fingering the manuscript; then suddenly
      turning and facing him&mdash;&ldquo;you and I can't do this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; he cried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's going to be emotional tension between us, why&mdash;-it's
      going to Be hard to do the work.&rdquo; She took the manuscript up now and
      looked thoughtfully from page to page. &ldquo;As I see the situation&mdash;if I
      see it at all&mdash;it's like this: You have solved our problem.
      Splendidly. There's our play. Like the rest of us, you are giving all you
      have. We've got to work hard. More, we've got to cooperate, very finely
      and earnestly. But we've got to be IMpersonal, businesslike. We've simply
      <i>got</i> to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said he ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, if our wires&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;are going to get crossed like&mdash;like
      this, well, you and I just mustn't see each other, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad. When you were reading the scenario, and I saw what power
      and life you have put into it, I thought it would be particularly
      interesting to have you coach me. You could help me so. But it is
      something, at least&mdash;&rdquo; she threw out her arms again with the gesture
      that he was sure he would associate with her as long as he lived&mdash;as
      he would remember the picture she made, seated there on an arm of the
      Morris chair, in his rooms....
    </p>
    <p>
      His rooms! How often in his plays had he based his big scene on Her visit
      to His Rooms! And how very, very different all those scenes had been from
      this. He was bewildered, trying to follow her extraordinarily calm survey
      of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking on. &ldquo;&mdash;it is something at least to know that you have
      been able to do this for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped off the arm of the chair now and stood before him&mdash;flushed,
      but calm enough&mdash;and extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way, I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is for you not to see much of me just
      now. That won't interfere with work at rehearsals, of course. If there's
      something you want to tell me about the part, you can drop me a line or
      call me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter took her hand, clasped it for a moment, let it fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved deliberately to the door. He followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Peter huskily&mdash;&ldquo;but, wouldn't I better walk home
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, momentarily compressing her lips. &ldquo;No! Better not! The
      time to start being businesslike is right now. Don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You are right, of course.&rdquo; The telephone bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sue waited, by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter took up the receiver. She heard him stammer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, all right&mdash;eleven o'clock&mdash;all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, laughing a little. &ldquo;It has happened, you see! I'm being
      put out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that doesn't matter! It's just amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wouldn't have had it happen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice trailed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said she again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Sue. You are treating me better than I deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't talk any more about it. Good night.&rdquo; She tried to turn the catch
      on the lock. He reached out to help. His hand closed over hers. He turned;
      his eyes met hers; he took her in his arms again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved slowly back toward the fire. &ldquo;Peter&mdash;please!&rdquo; she
      murmured. &ldquo;It won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sue&mdash;Sue!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;If we feel this way, why not marry and
      make a good job of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said this as she might have said it&mdash;all directness,
      matter-of-fact. &ldquo;I wouldn't stop you, Sue. I wouldn't ever dominate you or
      take you for granted. I'd live for you, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She caught her breath and moved away from him. &ldquo;You wouldn't
      stop me, but marriage and life would. No, Peter; not now. Marriage isn't
      on my calendar.... And, Peter, please don't make love to me. I don't want
      you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter moved away, too, at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Sue,&rdquo; he said, after a moment's thought, rather roughly, &ldquo;you
      go. We won't shake hands again. Just go. Right now. I promise I won't
      bother you. And we&mdash;we'll put the play through&mdash;put it through
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on his again, with a light in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow smile was coming to the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter,&rdquo; she said very gently, &ldquo;don't you&mdash;when you say that&mdash;you
      make me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;please go!&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think over the matter of the trip south,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue, I want you to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and let you know&rdquo;. I'm not sure but what you're right. If we <i>can</i>
      do it up here....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Sue! Please! Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved slowly toward the door, turned the catch herself, then glanced
      hesitatingly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was standing rigidly before the fire, staring into it. He had picked
      up the poker and was holding it stiffly in his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that the man standing there was not Peter at all, but a
      very famous personage, shorter than Peter, and stouter, whose name had
      rung resoundingly down the slope of a hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not turn. So she went out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;TWO GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is not a simple
      matter to record in any detail the violent emotional reaction through
      which Peter now passed. Peter had the gift of creative imagination, the
      egotism to drive it far, and, for background, the character of a
      theatrical chameleon. Of these qualities, I have always believed that the
      egotism predominated. He could appear dignified, even distinguished; he
      could also appear excitable, ungoverned. Either would be Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that had happened hitherto in his life had excited him as had the
      events of this evening. The excitement was, indeed, greater than he could
      bear. It set his imagination blazing, and there was among Peter's
      intricate emotional processes no hose of common sense adequate to the task
      of subduing the flames. He stood, breathless, quivering, at the window,
      looking out over the dim Square, exulting to the point of nervous
      exhaustion. He walked the floor. He laughed aloud. Finally, his spirit
      went on around the emotional circle through a high point of crazy
      happiness to an equally crazy despondency. More time passed. The
      despondency deepened. She had made stipulations. He was not to see her
      again. If it should be necessary to communicate, he was to write. She had
      been kind about it, but that was what she had said. Yes, she had been
      kind, but her reaction would come as his had. She would hate him.
      Necessarily. Hy was to that extent right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the couch (where she had sat), held the paper in shaking hands
      and stared wildly into the dying fire. Thoughts, pictures, were now racing
      through his mind, in a mad tangle, hopelessly confused. One notion he laid
      hold of as it went by... She had been his guest&mdash;here in his rooms.
      She had trusted herself with him. He had violated the trust. If he
      permitted a man to do such a thing in one of his plays, it would be for
      the purpose of exhibiting that man as a cad at least&mdash;probably as a
      villain. The inference was clear. Any audience that Peter was capable of
      mentally projecting would instantly, automatically, accept him as such.
      Peter himself knew no other attitude. And now to find himself guilty of
      this very act brought the final bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he, Peter, was a cad at least&mdash;perhaps a villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at the lowest ebb of his reaction, his imagination set to work
      building up grotesque plans for a new different life. All these plans were
      out of the conventional stuff of his plays; all were theatrical. They had
      to do with self-effacement and sacrifice, with expiation, with true
      nobility. There was a moment when he considered self-destruction. If you
      think this wholly fantastic, I can only say that it was Peter. Another
      notion was of turning explorer, becoming a world's rough hand, of meeting
      hardship and privation. He pictured himself writing Sue manly letters,
      once a year, say. He would live then in her memory not as a cad or
      villain, but (perhaps) as a man who had been broken by a great love. Then,
      in reminiscent moments, as when she saw a log fire burning low, she would
      think tenderly of him. She might even sigh.... And he tried to think out
      acceptable devices for leaving his money in her hands. For he must see the
      Nature Film through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just finished deciding this when Hy Lowe came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Peter been less preoccupied, he would have noted that Hy was unusually
      silent. As it was, conscious only that the atmosphere of magical
      melancholy had been shattered when the door opened, Peter undressed, put
      out the gas lamp and went to bed, his bed being the very couch on which
      she had curled up while he read the scenario. He knew that sleep would be
      impossible, but he felt that he should make every possible effort to
      control himself. Hy was fussing about in the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while&mdash;a long while&mdash;he heard Hy come tiptoeing into the
      room and stand motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you want!&rdquo; cried Peter, starting up, all nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wanted to make sure you weren't asleep.&rdquo; And Hy chuckled
      breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit your cackling! What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me sit down, Pete. Damn it. I've got to talk&mdash;to somebody. Pete,
      I'm crazy. I'm delirious. Never mind what I say. Oh, my boy. My boy, you
      don't know&mdash;you can't imagine!... She's the darling of the gods,
      Peter! The absolute darling of the absolute gods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that any reason why you should come driveling all over my room at this
      time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Pete&mdash;serious now. You've got to stand by me in this. The way
      I've stood by you once or twice. To-day was Friday, wasn't it? Or am I
      crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's to-morrow! I'm just trying to believe it, Pete, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe <i>what?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;you've got to know, and protect me if any unexpected
      thing should come up. We're going on a little trip, Peter.&rdquo; Hy was solemn
      now, but his voice was uncertain. &ldquo;Betty and I, Pete. To-morrow. On the
      night boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was silent. Hy stood there for what seemed rather a long time, then
      suddenly bolted back into the bedroom. In the morning he was less
      expansive, merely asking Peter to respect his confidence. Which request
      Peter gloomily resented as he resented Hy's luck. The fortunate young man
      then packed a hand-bag and hurried off to breakfast at the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter tried to work on an empty stomach, but the effort gave him a
      headache, so he made himself a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked the streets for a while with increasing restlessness; then, to
      soothe his nerves, went to the club and listlessly read the magazines. At
      noon he avoided his friends, but managed to eat a small luncheon. At two
      o'clock he went out aimlessly and entered the nearest moving-picture
      theater. At five he wandered back to the club and furtively asked the
      telephone boy if there' had been any messages for him. There had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He permitted himself to be drawn into a riotous game of Kelly pool. Also
      he permitted himself a drink or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening, I regret to note, he got himself rather drunk and went
      home in a taxicab. This was unusual with Peter and not successful. It
      intensified his self-consciousness and his sorrow, made him even gloomier.
      But it did help him to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened, just before nine o'clock on Sunday morning, by the
      banging of a door. Then Hy, dusty, bedraggled, haggard of face, rushed in
      and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter decided it was a dream and rolled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy shook him. &ldquo;For God's sake, Pete!&rdquo; he cried. How hoarse he was! &ldquo;Where
      is she? Have you heard anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was coming awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, Pete, I'm crazy! Don't you understand&mdash;She wasn't on the boat.
      Must have got the wrong one. Oh, it's awful!... I walked that deck nearly
      all night&mdash;got off way up the river and came back to New York with
      the milk cans. Something terrible may have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his tousled head, &ldquo;that I remember
      something&mdash;last night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy waited, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look on the desk. Didn't I bring up a note or something and lay it
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy was on the desk like a panther. There was a note. He tore it open, then
      thrust it into Peter's hands, crying hoarsely, &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      dropped, a limp, dirt-streaked wreck of a man, into the Morris chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Henry, I'm not going. I hope this reaches you in time. Please
      understand&mdash;forgive if you can. You won't see me again. B.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter read it again, thoughtfully; then looked up. His own none-too-clear
      eyes met Hy's distinctly bloodshot ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of that!&rdquo; cried Hy. &ldquo;What do you think of that!...
      Damn women, anyway! They don't play the game. They're not square.&rdquo;... He
      was clenching and unclenching his hands. Suddenly he reached for the
      telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as his hand closed on it, the bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy snatched up the receiver. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he cried shortly&mdash;&ldquo;Yes! Yes! He
      lives here. Wait a moment, please. It's for you, Fete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sprang out of bed and hurried to the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is Mr. Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, it's Sue&mdash;Sue Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;hello! I was going to call up myself in a few minutes. How have
      you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not awfully fit. This constant rehearsing seems to be on my nerves, or
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Hy went off into the bedroom to get out of his
      travel-stained clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to say, Peter&mdash;I've been thinking it all over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter braced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I've come to the conclusion that you are right about that
      southern trip. It really isn't necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you feel that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. And we must make Zanin see it as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another pause. Then this from Peter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Can't work. Wish we could do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like some air&mdash;to get away from the streets and that stuffy
      theater. What could we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what you need, child&mdash;just the thing! We'll run down
      to one of the beaches and tramp. Pick up lunch anywhere. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it, Peter. Call for me, will you?... And oh, Peter, here's an odd
      thing! Betty packed up yesterday while I was out and went home. Just left
      a note. She has run away&mdash;given up. Going to marry a man in her town.
      He makes gas engines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter started the coffee machine, smiling as he worked. A sense of deep
      utter calm was flowing into his harassed spirit, pervading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the bedroom and gazed with tolerant concern at the downcast
      Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you, my boy,&rdquo; he began, then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the trouble with me?&rdquo; growled Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you, my boy, is that you don't understand women.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE WORM TURNS FROM BOOKS TO LIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Worm worked
      hard all of this particular day at the Public Library, up at Forty-second
      Street and Fifth Avenue. At five o'clock he came out, paused on the vast
      incline of marble steps to consider the spraying fountains of pale green
      foliage on the terraces (it was late April) and the brilliant thronging
      avenue and decided not to ride down to Washington Square on an autobus,
      but to save the ten cents and walk. Which is how he came to meet Sue
      Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was moving slowly along with the stream of pedestrians, her old coat
      open, her big tarn o'shanter hanging down behind her head and framing her
      face in color. The face itself, usually vital, was pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and walked with him. She was loafing, she said listlessly,
      watching the crowds and trying to think. And she added: &ldquo;It helps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just feeling them crowding around&mdash;I don't know; it seems to keep
      you from forgetting that everybody else has problems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed her lips on this bit of self-revelation. They walked a
      little way in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour's work at home clearing up my notes, then nothing. Thinking
      of dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll meet you. Wherever you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Muscovy, then. By seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped as if to turn away, hesitated, lingered, gazing out with sober
      eyes at the confusion of limousines, touring cars and taxis that rolled
      endlessly by, with here and there a high green bus lumbering above all the
      traffic. &ldquo;Maybe we can have another of our talks, Henry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      hope so. I need it&mdash;or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you're working too hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this, shook her head, turned abruptly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the old bachelor rookery in the Square he did not enter,
      but walked twice around the block, thinking about Sue. It had disturbed
      him to see that tired look in her odd deep-green eyes. Sue had been vivid,
      striking, straightforward; fired with a finely honest revolt against the
      sham life into an observance of which nearly all of us, soon or late, get
      beaten down. He didn't want to see Sue beaten down like the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant that she, too, had felt deeply about their friendship.
      This thought brought a thrill of the sort that had to be put down quickly;
      for nothing could have been plainer than, that he stirred no thrill in
      Sue. No, he was not in the running there. He lived in books, the Worm; and
      he reflected with a rather unaccustomed touch of bitterness that books are
      pale things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, now&mdash;he had seemed lately to be in the running.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it hardly seemed that Peter could be the one who had brought problems
      into Sue's life.... Jacob Zanin&mdash;there was another story! He was in
      the running decidedly. In that odd frank way of hers, Sue had given the
      Worm glimpses of this relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rounded the block a third time&mdash;a fourth&mdash;a fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the apartment Peter was there, in the studio, telephoning.
      To a girl, unquestionably. You could always tell, &ldquo;You aren't fair to me.
      You throw me aside without a word of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Peter; his voice, pitched a little high, near to breaking with
      emotion; as if he were pleading with the one girl in the world&mdash;though,
      to be fair to Peter, she almost always was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm stepped into the bedroom, making as much noise as possible. But
      Peter talked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are taking exactly that position. As you know, I share your
      interest in freedom&mdash;but freedom without fairness or decent human
      consideration or even respect for one's word, comes down to selfish
      caprice. Yes, selfish caprice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm picked up a chair and banged it against the door-post. But even
      this failed to stop Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, my dear, of course I didn't mean that. I didn't know what I was
      saying. You can't imagine how I have looked forward to seeing you this
      evening. The thought of it has been with me all through this hard, hard
      day. I know my nerves are a wreck. I'm all out of tune. But everything
      seems to have landed on me at once...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding the chair useless as a warning, the Worm sat upon it, made a wry
      face, folded his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... I've got to go away. You knew that, dear. This was my last chance to
      see you for weeks&mdash;and yet you speak of seeing me any time. It hurts,
      little girl. It just plain hurts to be put off like that. It doesn't seem
      like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm wondered, rather casually, to how many girls Peter had talked in
      this way during the past three years&mdash;stage girls, shop girls&mdash;the
      pretty little Irish one, from the glove counter up-town; and that young
      marred person on the upper West Side of whom Peter had been unable to
      resist bragging a little; and Maria Tonifetti, manicurist at the sanitary
      barber shop of Marius; and&mdash;oh, yes, and Grace Herring. Only last
      year. The actress. She played Lena in Peter's <i>The Buzzard</i>, and
      later made a small sensation in <i>The Gold Heart</i>. That affair had
      looked, for several months, like the real thing. The Worm recalled one
      tragic night, all of which, until breakfast rime, he had passed in that
      very studio talking Peter out of suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered who this new girl could be. Was it Sue, by any chance? Were
      they that far along?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm got up with some impatience and went in there&mdash;just as Peter
      angrily slammed the receiver on its hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you're going away,&rdquo; the Worm observed
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter swung around and peered through his big glasses. He made a visible
      effort to compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hello! What's that? Yes, I'm leaving to-morrow afternoon.
      Neuerman is going to put <i>The Truffler</i> on the road for a few; weeks
      this spring to try out the cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm regarded him thoughtfully. &ldquo;Look here, Pete,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it isn't
      my fault that God gave me ears. I heard your little love scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked blankly at him; then his face twisted convulsively and he
      buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henry!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;It's awful. I'm in love, man!&rdquo; His voice was
      really trembling. &ldquo;It's got me at last&mdash;the real thing. I must tell
      somebody&mdash;it's racking me to pieces&mdash;I can't work, can't sleep.
      It's Sue Wilde. I've asked her to marry me&mdash;she can't make up her
      mind. And now; I've got to go away for weeks and leave things...
      Za-Zanin...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat up, stiffened his shoulders, bit his lip. The Worm feared he was
      going to cry. But instead he sprang up, rushed from the room and, a moment
      later, from the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm sat on a corner of the desk and looked after him, thought about
      him, let his feelings rise a little.... Peter, even in his anger and
      confusion, had managed to look unruffled, well-groomed. He always did. No
      conceivable outburst of emotion could have made him forget to place his
      coat on the hanger and crease his trousers carefully in the frame. His
      various suits were well made. They fitted him. They represented thought
      and money. His shoes&mdash;eight or nine pairs in all&mdash;were custom
      made and looked it. His scarfs were of imported silk. His collars came
      from England and cost forty cents each. His walking sticks had
      distinction.... And Peter was successful with women. No doubt about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm gazed down at himself. The old gray suit was; a shapeless thing.
      The coat pockets bulged&mdash;note-book and wad of loose notes on one
      side, a paper-bound volume in the Russian tongue on the other. He had just
      one other suit. It hung from a hook in the closet, and he knew that it,
      too, was shapeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clock, somewhere outside, struck seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started; stuffed his note-book and papers into a drawer; drew the
      volume in Russian from his other pocket, made as if to lay it on the
      table, then hesitated. It was his custom to have some reading always by
      him. Sue might be late. She often was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he raised the book above his head and threw it against the wall
      at the other end of the room. Then he picked up his old soft hat (he never
      wore an overcoat) and rushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Muscovy is a basement restaurant near Washington Square. You get into
      it from the street by stumbling down a dark twisting flight of uneven
      steps and opening a door under a high stoop. Art dines here and Anarchism;
      Ideas sit cheek by jowl with the Senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue was not late. She sat in the far corner at one of the few small tables
      in the crowded room. Two men, a poet and a painter, lounged against the
      table and chatted with her languidly. She had brightened a little for
      them. There was a touch of color in her cheeks and some life in her eyes.
      The Worm noted this fact as he made his way toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet and the painter wandered languidly away. The chatter of the
      crowded smoky room rose to its diurnal climax; passed it as by twos and
      threes the diners drifted out to the street or up-stairs to the dancing
      and reading-rooms of the Freewoman's Club; and then rapidly died to
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two belated couples strolled in, settled themselves sprawlingly at the
      long center table and discussed with the offhand, blandly sophisticated
      air that is the Village manner the currently accepted psychology of sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was smoking now&mdash;his old brier pipe&mdash;and felt a bit
      more like his quietly whimsical self. Sue, however, was moody over her
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pasty-faced, very calm young man, with longish hair, came in and joined
      in the discussion at the center table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue followed this person with troubled eyes, &ldquo;Listen, Henry!&rdquo; she said
      then, &ldquo;I'm wondering&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;for the first time in two years&mdash;if I belong in Greenwich
      Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've asked myself the same question, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark perturbed her a little; as if it had not before occurred to
      her that other eyes were reading her. Then she rushed on&mdash;&ldquo;Take
      Waters Coryell over there&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the pasty-faced one&mdash;&ldquo;I
      used to think he was wonderful. But he's all words, Like the rest of us.
      He always carries that calm assumption of being above ordinary human
      limitations. He talks comradeship and the perfect freedom. But I've had a
      glimpse into his methods&mdash;Abbie Esterzell, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and it isn't a pretty story. I've watched the women, too&mdash;the
      free lovers. Henry, they're tragic. When they get just a little older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded again. &ldquo;But we were talking about you, Sue. You're not all
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I am. All talk, theories, abstractions. It gets you, down here. You
      do it, like all the others. It's a sort of mental taint. Yet it has been
      every thing to me. I've believed it, heart and soul. It has been my
      religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much on generalizing, Sue,&rdquo; observed the Worm, &ldquo;but sometimes I
      have thought that there's a lot of bunk in this freedom theory&mdash;'self-realization,'
      'the complete life,' so on. I notice that most of the men and women I
      really admire aren't worried about their liberty, Sometimes I've thought
      that there's a limit to our human capacity for freedom just as there's a
      limit to our capacity for food and drink and other pleasant things&mdash;sort
      of a natural boundary. The people that try to pass that boundary seem to
      detach themselves in some vital way from actual life. They get unreal&mdash;act
      queer&mdash;<i>are</i> queer. They reach a point where their pose is all
      they've got. As you say, it's a taint. It's a noble thing, all right, to
      light and bleed and die for freedom for others. But it seems to work out
      unhappily when people, men or women, insist too strongly on freedom for
      their individual selves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sue apparently was not listening. Her cheeks&mdash;they were flushed&mdash;rested
      on her small fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's a pretty serious thing to lose your religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losing yours, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought this little eddy of talk was real life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Oh, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you encountered reality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, startled, vivid, now somber, flashed up at him. &ldquo;Henry, how did
      you know? What do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, Sue. But I know you a little. And I've thought about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, her eyes down again, suppression in her voice&mdash;&ldquo;then
      they aren't talking about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I've heard. Sue. Though it would hardly come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip. &ldquo;There you have it, Henry. With the ideas I've held, and
      talked everywhere, I ought not to care what they say. But I do care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. They all do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; She considered this. &ldquo;You said something a moment ago
      that perhaps explains&mdash;about the natural boundary of human
      freedom.... Listen! You knew Betty Deane, the girl that roomed with me?
      Well, less than a year ago, after letting herself go some all the year&mdash;it's
      fair enough to say that, to you; she didn't cover her tracks&mdash;she
      suddenly ran off and married a manufacturer up in her home town. I'm sure
      there wasn't any love in it. I know it, from things she said and did. All
      the while he was after her she was having her good times here. I suppose
      she had reached the boundary. She married in a panic. She was having a
      little affair with your friend&mdash;what's his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hy Lowe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm smiled faintly. The incorrigible Hy had within the week set up a
      fresh attachment. This time it was a new girl in the Village&mdash;one
      Hilda Hansen, from Wisconsin, who designed wall-paper part of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he realized that Sue, with a deeper flush now and a look in her eyes
      that he did not like to see there, was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I found out what Betty had done I said some savage things, Henry.
      Called her a coward. Oh, I was very superior&mdash;very sure of myself.
      And here's the grotesque irony of it.&rdquo; Her voice was unsteady. &ldquo;Here's
      what one little unexpected contact with reality can do to the sort of
      scornful independent mind I had. Twenty-four hours&mdash;less than that&mdash;after
      Betty went I found myself soberly considering doing the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrying?&rdquo; The Worm's voice was suddenly low and a thought husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man you don't love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had moments of thinking I loved him, hours of wondering how I could,
      possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was some time in getting out his next remark. It was, &ldquo;You'd better
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her hands in an expressive way she had. &ldquo;Wait? Yes, that's
      what I've told myself, Henry. But I've lost my old clear sense of things.
      My nerves aren't steady. I have queer reactions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed her lips as she had once before on this day, up there on
      the avenue. She even seemed to compose herself. Waters Coryell came over
      from the other table and for a little time talked down to them from his
      attitude of self-perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone the Worm said, to make talk, &ldquo;How are the pictures coming
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw that he had touched the same tired nerve center. Her flush
      began to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; she said; and thought for a moment, with knit brows and
      pursed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her hands again. &ldquo;They're quarreling, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin and Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;It started over Zanin's publicity. He is a genius, you know.
      Any sort of effort that will help get the picture across looks legitimate
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; mused the Worm, trying to resume the modestly judicial habit
      of mind that had seemed lately to be leaving him, &ldquo;I suppose, in a way, he
      is right. It is terribly hard to make a success of such an enterprise. It
      is like war&mdash;-the only possible course is to win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said she, rather shortly. &ldquo;But then there's the expense
      side of it. Zanin keeps getting the bit in his teeth.... Lately I've begun
      to see that these quarrels are just the surface. The real clash lies
      deeper. It's partly racial, I suppose, and partly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She threw out her hands. &ldquo;They're fighting over me. I don't mind it
      so much in Peter. He has only lately come to see things our way. He never
      made the professions Zanin has of being superior to passions, jealousies,
      the sense of possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, brooding, oblivious now to her surroundings, slowly shaking
      her head. &ldquo;Zanin has always said that the one real wrong is to take or
      accept love where it isn't real enough to justify itself. But now when I
      won't see him&mdash;those are the times he runs wild with the business.
      Then Peter has to row with him to check the awful waste of money. Peter's
      rather wonderful about it. He never loses his courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a new picture of Peter. The Worm gave thought to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First he took Zanin's disconnected abstractions and made a real film
      drama out of them. It's big stuff, Henry. Powerful and fine. And then he
      threw in every cent he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter threw in every cent!...&rdquo; The Worm was startled upright, pipe in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every cent, Henry. All his savings. And never a grudging word. Not about
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her chin on her hands. Tears were in her eyes. Her boy-cut
      short hair had lately grown out a little, and was rumpled where she had
      run her fingers through it. It was fine-spun hair and thick on her head.
      It was all high lights and rich brown shades. The Worm found himself
      wishing it was long and free, rippling down over her shoulders. He
      thought, too, of the fine texture of her skin, just beneath the hair. A
      warm glow was creeping through his nervous system and into his mind.... He
      set his teeth hard on his pipestem.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back more relaxed and spoke in a quieter tone. &ldquo;You know how I
      feel about things, Henry. I quit my home. I have put on record my own
      little protest against the conventional lies we are all fed on from the
      cradle here in America. I went into this picture thing with my eyes open,
      because it was what I believed in. It wasn't a pleasant thought&mdash;making
      myself so conspicuous, acting for the camera without clothes enough to
      keep me warm. I believed in Zanin, too. And it seemed to be a way in which
      I could really do something for him&mdash;after all he had done for me.
      But it hasn't turned out well. The ideals seem to have oozed out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she hesitated; thought a little; then added: &ldquo;The thing I didn't
      realize was that I was pouring out all my emotional energy. I had Zanin's
      example always before me. He never tires. He is iron. The Jews are, I
      think. But&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; she tried to smile, without great success&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
      I'm not iron. Henry, I'm tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm slept badly that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, after Peter and Hy Lowe had gone, the Worm stood
      gloomily surveying his books&mdash;between two and three hundred of them,
      filling the case of shelves between the front wall and the fireplace,
      packed in on end and sidewise and heaped haphazard on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a hundred volumes in calf and nearly as many in Morocco dated from a
      youthful period when bindings mattered. College years were represented by
      a shabby row&mdash;Eschuylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Plutarch,
      Virgil and Horace. He had another Horace in immaculate tree calf. There
      was a group of early Italians; an imposing Dante; a Boccaccio, very rare,
      in a dated Florentine binding; a gleaning of French history, philosophy
      and <i>belles-lettres</i> from Phillippe de Comines and Villon through
      Rabelais, Le Sage. Racine, Corneille and the others, to Bergson, Brieux,
      Rolland and Anatole France&mdash;with, of course, Flaubert, de Maupassant
      and a tattered series of <i>Les Trois Mousquetaires</i> in seven volumes;
      some modern German playwrights, Hauptmann and Schnitzler among them; Ibsen
      in two languages; Strindberg in English; Gogol, Tchekov, Gorky,
      Dostoïevski, of the Russians (in that tongue); the modern psychologists&mdash;Forel,
      Havelock Ellis, Freud&mdash;and the complete works of William James in
      assorted shapes and bindings, gathered painstakingly through the years.
      Walt Whitman was there, Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, much of Galsworthy, Wells
      and Conrad, <i>The Story of Gosta Berling</i>, John Masefield, and a
      number of other recent poets and novelists. All his earthly treasures were
      on those shelves; there, until now, had his heart been also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from its shelf the rare old Boccaccio in the dated binding, tied a
      string around it, went down the corridor with it to the bathroom, filled
      the tub with cold water and tossed the book in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It bobbed up to the surface and floated there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned&mdash;sat on the rim of the tub and watched it for ten minutes.
      It still floated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought it back to the studio then and set to work methodically making
      up parcels of books, using all the newspapers he could find. Into each
      parcel went a weight&mdash;the two ends of the brass book-holder on the
      desk, a bronze elephant, a heavy glass paper-weight, a pint bottle of ink,
      an old monkey-wrench, the two bricks from the fireplace that had served as
      andirons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked in a fever of determination. By two o'clock that afternoon he
      had completed a series of trips across the West Side and over various
      ferry lines, and his entire library lay at the bottom of the North River.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the last of these trips, feeling curiously light of heart, he
      returned to find a taxi waiting at the curb and in the studio Peter, hat,
      coat and one glove on, his suit-case on a chair, furiously writing a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter finished, leaned back, mopped his forehead. &ldquo;The books,&rdquo; he
      murmured, waving a vague hand toward the shelves. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm through with books. Going in for reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; mused the eminent playwright&mdash;&ldquo;a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, you're wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chucking your whole past life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's chucked.&rdquo; Then the Worm hesitated. For a moment his breath nearly
      failed him. He stood balancing on the brink of the unknown; and he knew he
      had to make the plunge. &ldquo;Pete&mdash;I've got a few hundred stuck away&mdash;and,
      anyhow, I'm going out for a real job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A job! You! What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;newspaper man, maybe. I want the address&mdash;who is your
      tailor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter jotted it down. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here's our itinerary. Stick
      it in your pocket.&rdquo; Then he gazed at the Worm in a sort of solemn humor.
      &ldquo;So the leopard is changing his spots,&rdquo; he mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that,&rdquo; replied the Worm, flushing,' then reduced to a
      grin&mdash;as he pocketed the tailor's address&mdash;&ldquo;but this particular
      Ethiop is sure going to make a stab at changing his skin.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;ZANIN MAKES HIMSELF FELT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UE was in her
      half-furnished living-room&mdash;not curled comfortably on the couch-bed,
      as she would have been a month or two earlier, but sitting rather stiffly
      in a chair, a photograph in her listless hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin&mdash;big, shaggy, sunburnt&mdash;walked the floor. &ldquo;Are you turning
      conventional, Sue?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What is it? You puzzle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want that picture used, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a cigarette, dropped on a wooden chair, tipped it Lack against
      the wall, twisted his feet around the front legs, drummed on the front of
      the seat with big fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached for the photograph. It was Sue herself, as she would appear in
      one of the more daring scenes of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an honest picture, Sue&mdash;right off the film.&rdquo; She was very
      quiet. &ldquo;It's the singling it out, Jacob. In the film it is all movement,
      action&mdash;it passes. It doesn't stay before their eyes.&rdquo; A little
      feeling crept into her voice. &ldquo;I agreed to do the film, Jacob. I'm doing
      it. Am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're drawing a rather sharp line, Sue. We've got to hit them hard
      with this thing. I don't expect Mann to understand. I've got to work along
      with him as best I can and let it go at that. But I count on you.&rdquo; The
      legs of the chair came down with a bang. He sprang up and walked the floor
      again. His cigarette consumed, he lighted another with the butt, which
      latter he tossed into a corner of the room. Sue's eyes followed it there.
      She was still gazing at it when Zanin paused before her. She could feel
      him looking down at her. She wished it were possible to avoid discussion
      just now. There had been so many discussions during these crowded two
      years.... She raised her eyes. There were his, fixed on her. He was not
      tired. His right hand was plunged into his thick hair; his left hand held
      the cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're none too fit, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved her hands in assert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's something to be considered seriously. We need you fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer at once. She would have liked to send him away. She
      tried to recall the long slow series of events, each dovetailed so
      intricately into the next that had brought them so close. Her mind&mdash;her
      sense of fairness&mdash;told her that he had every right to stand there
      and talk at her; yet he seemed suddenly and oddly a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we stop discussing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;It's quite time to begin discussing you. It's
      suppressions, Sue. You've played the Village game with your mind, but
      you've kept your feelings under. The result is natural enough&mdash;your
      nerves are in a knot. You must let go&mdash;trust your emotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust my emotions enough,&rdquo; said she shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked back and forth. &ldquo;Let's look at this dispassionately, Sue. We
      can, you and I. Of course I love you&mdash;you know that. There have been
      women enough in my life, but none of them has stirred my blood as you
      have. Not one. I want you&mdash;desperately&mdash;every minute&mdash;month
      in, month out. But&rdquo;&mdash;he stood before her again&mdash;&ldquo;if you can't
      let go with me, I'd almost&mdash;surely, yes, I can say it, I'd rather it
      would be somebody else then. But somebody, something. You're all buttled
      up. It's dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stirred restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that as well as I.&rdquo; He was merciless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it was he really seemed dispassionate. For the moment she
      could not question his sincerity. He went on&mdash;&ldquo;As lately as last
      winter you would have carried all this off with a glorious flare. It's
      this suppression that has got to your nerves, as it was bound to. You're
      dodging, I'm afraid. You're refusing life.&rdquo; He lit another cigarette.
      &ldquo;It's damn puzzling. At heart you are, I know, a thoroughbred. I can't
      imagine you marrying for a living or to escape love. You're intelligent&mdash;too
      intelligent for that.&rdquo; She moved restlessly, picked up the photograph and
      studied it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't go back to that home of yours...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going back there,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can't quit. We're too deep in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk about that, Jacob!&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;I'm not going to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped casually on the arm of her chair. One big hand rested on the
      chair-back, the other took hers and held it, with the picture, a little
      higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed for an instant to shrink away; then, with slightly compressed
      lips, sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I am squeamish,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; They both looked at the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Sue&mdash;why on earth!... What is it, anyway? Are you all of a
      sudden ashamed of your body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't expect me to explain. I know I'm inconsistent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand; then his other big hand very quietly stroked her
      hair, slid down to her forehead, rested slightly on her flushed temple and
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're almost in a fever. You've got to do
      something. Don't you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's tearing you to pieces, this giving the lie to your own beliefs.
      You've got to let go, Sue! For God's sake, be human! Accept a little
      happiness. You're not a small person. You are gifted, big. But you've got
      to live the complete life. It's the only answer.... See here. Peter's
      away, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left last Thursday... I had a note...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't,&rdquo; Zanin smiled grimly. &ldquo;It's Tuesday, now. We can't do those
      outdoor scenes yet. You come away with me. I'll take you off into the
      hills somewhere&mdash;over in Pennsylvania or up-state. Let's have some
      happiness, Sue. And give me a chance to take a little real care of you.
      Half my strength is rusting right now because you won't use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she sprang up, leaped across the room, whirled against the wall
      and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she faltered perceptibly, for on his face she saw only frank
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, Sue!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That's the old fire! Damn it, girl, don't let's be
      childish about this! You and I don't need to get all of a flutter at the
      thought of love. If I didn't stir an emotional response in you do you
      think I'd want you? But I do.&rdquo; He rose and came to her. He gripped her
      shoulders and made her look at him. &ldquo;Child, for God's sake, don't all at
      once forget everything you know! Where's your humor? Can't you see that
      this is exactly what you've got to have&mdash;that somebody has got to
      stir you as I'm stirring you now! If I couldn't reach you, it would have
      to be some one else. A little love won't hurt you any. The real danger
      I've been fearing is that no man would be able to stir you. That would be
      the tragedy. You're a live vital girl. You're an artist. Of course you've
      got to have love. You'll never do real work without it. You'll never even
      grow up without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not meet his eyes. And she had a disheartening feeling that he
      was reasonable and right, granting the premises of their common
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hands away. She heard him strike a match and light a
      cigarette, then move about the room. Then his voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Sue&mdash;will you pack a bag and start off with me?
      It'll do both of us good. It'll give us new life for our job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>

    <p>
      She was shaking her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was only this,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully enough&mdash;&ldquo;but it's
      everything. Peter is lying down on me and now you are failing me utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped on a chair by the door. &ldquo;That's the hardest thing you ever
      said to me, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. I'm not blaming you. But it is a fact I have to meet.... Sue,
      do you think for one moment I intend being beaten in this enterprise?
      Don't you know me better than that? You are failing me. Not in love&mdash;that
      is personal. But in the work. Lately I have feared that Peter had your
      love. Now, Sue, if I am not to have you I can almost wish he had. When you
      do accept love it will hurt you. I have no doubt of that. There will be
      reactions. The conventional in you will stab and stab. But you are not
      little, and you will feel the triumph of it. It will make you. After all,
      however it may come, through door or window, love is life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had folded her hands in her lap and was looking down at them. &ldquo;I have
      no doubt you are right,&rdquo; she said slowly and quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a weary sigh. &ldquo;Of course. Your own intelligence tells you.... If
      you won't go with me, Sue, I may slip away alone. I've got to think. I've
      got to get money. I can get it, and I will. A little more energy, a little
      more expenditure of personality will do it. It can always be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mind roused and seized on this as a momentary diversion. &ldquo;Do you mean
      to go outside for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes to that. Don't you know, Sue, that we're too far in with this
      thing to falter. The way to make money is to spend money. Peter's a
      chicken. If he won't come through, somebody's got to. Why it would cost
      more than a thousand dollars&mdash;perhaps two thousand&mdash;merely to do
      what I have planned to do with the picture you so suddenly dislike,&rdquo; He
      looked about for his hat. &ldquo;I'm going, Sue. I've let myself get stirred up;
      and that, of course, is foolishness. I'm just tiring you out. You can't
      help, I see that&mdash;not as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and leaned against the wall by the door. He took her arm as he
      reached her side. &ldquo;Buck up, little girl,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don't blame yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and for a long moment they stood thus. Then she heard
      him draw in his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arms were around her. He held her against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a kiss for me, Sue?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let her go then, and again she leaned against the walk
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If you could bring yourself to share the real thrill
      with me, I could help you. But I'm not going to wear you out with this
      crude sex-duel stuff. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said then. She moved over to the table, and fingered the
      photograph. He stood in the doorway and watched her. She was thinking&mdash;desperately
      thinking. He could see that. The flush was still on her temples and
      cheeks. Finally she straightened up and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can't let you go like that. This thing has got to be
      settled. Really settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me till Saturday, Jacob. I promise you I'll try to think it all out.
      I'll go through with the pictures anyway&mdash;somehow. As for this
      photograph, go ahead. Use it. Only please don't commit yourself in a money
      way before I see you. Come to tea Saturday, at four. I'll either tell you
      finally that we are&mdash;-well, hardly to be friends beyond the rest of
      this job of ours, or I'll&mdash;I'll go along with you, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice faltered over the last of this, but her eyes did not. And her
      chin was high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you're right. It isn't me. You've come to
      the point where you've got to find yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've got to try to find out what I am. If my
      thoughts and feelings have been misleading me&mdash;well, maybe I <i>am</i>
      conventional&mdash;maybe I <i>am</i> little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice broke. Her eyes filled. But she fought the tears back and still
      faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward her. She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out then.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the outer door shut she dropped limply on the couch-bed.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO days later, on
      Thursday, the Worm crossed the Square and Sixth Avenue and entered
      Greenwich Village proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed, at the top, in a soft gray hat from England. Next beneath
      was a collar that had cost him forty cents. The four-in-hand scarf was an
      imported foulard, of a flowering pattern in blues and greens; with a jade
      pin stuck in it. The new, perfectly fitting suit was of Donegal homespun
      and would cost, when the bill was paid, slightly more than sixty dollars.
      The shoes, if not custom made, were new. And he carried a slender stick
      with a curving silver head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt uncomfortably conspicuous. His nerves tingled with an emotional
      disturbance that ignored his attempts to dismiss it as something beneath
      him. For the first time in nearly a decade he was about to propose
      marriage to a young woman. As he neared the street on which the young
      woman lived, his steps slackened and his mouth became uncomfortably
      dry.... All this was absurd, of course. He and Sue were good friends.
      &ldquo;There needn't be all this excitement,&rdquo; he told himself with a desperate
      clutching at the remnants of his sense of humor, &ldquo;over suggesting to her
      that we change from a rational to an irrational relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the corner, however, he stopped dead. Then with a self-consciousness
      worthy of Peter himself, he covered his confusion by buying an afternoon
      paper and walking slowly back toward Sixth Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, savagely, he crumpled the paper into a ball, threw it into the
      street, strode resolutely to Sue's apartment-house and rang her bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue promptly lighted the alcohol lamp under her kettle and they had tea.
      Over the cups, feeling coldly desperate, the Worm said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been thinking you all over, Sue.&rdquo; It was a relief to find that his voice
      sounded fairly natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the remark rather lightly. &ldquo;I'm not worth it, Henry.... I've
      thought some myself&mdash;your idea of the boundary...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were moving on with disconcerting rapidity. He must take the
      plunge. It was his fate. He knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked marriage,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since then I've tried to figure but what I do think, and crystallize it.
      Sue, I'm not so sure that Betty was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a new slant,&rdquo; said she thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or very old. Just try to look through my eyes for a moment. Betty had
      tried freedom&mdash;had something of a fling at it. Now, it is evident
      that in her case it didn't work very well. Isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her case, yes,&rdquo; Sue observed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, in her case. She had reached the boundary. You'll admit that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue smiled faintly at his argumentative tone. &ldquo;Yes, I'll admit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty isn't a great soul. A stronger nature would have taken longer to
      reach the boundary. But doesn't it indicate that the boundary is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Sue hesitated. &ldquo;All right. For the sake of the argument I'll
      admit that, too.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, just what has Betty done? She doesn't love this manufacturer
      she has married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the marriage may fail. The majority of them, from an idealistic point
      of view, undoubtedly do fail. Admitting all that, you have let me see that
      you yourself in a weak moment have considered the same course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue's brow clouded. But she nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;he hitched forward in his chair, and to cover his
      burning eagerness talked, if possible, a shade more stiffly and
      impersonally&mdash;&ldquo;doesn't this, Betty's act and your momentary
      consideration of the same act, suggest that a sound instinct may be at
      work there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If cowardice is an instinct, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it is cowardice? From what data do you get that
      conclusion? Betty, after all her philandering, has undertaken a definite
      contract. It binds her. It is a job. There is discipline in it, a chance
      for service. It creates new conditions of life which will certainly change
      her unless she quits. Haven't you noticed, all your life, what a relief it
      is to get out of indecision into a definite course, even if it costs you
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that faint smile of hers. &ldquo;Turning conservative, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ignored this. &ldquo;Life moves on in epochs, Sue. If you don't start getting
      educated when you're a youngster, you go most awfully wrong. If you don't
      accept the discipline of work as soon as you've got a little education and
      grown up, you're a slacker and before long you're very properly rated as a
      slacker. So with a woman&mdash;given this wonderful function of motherhood
      and the big emotional capacity that goes with it&mdash;if she waits too
      long after her body and Spirit have ripened she goes wrong, emotionally
      and spiritually. There's a time with a normal woman when love and
      maternity are&mdash;well, the next thing. Not with every woman of course.
      But pretty certainly with the woman who reaches that time, refuses
      marriage, and then is forced to admit that her life isn't working out.
      Peter has coined the word for what that woman becomes&mdash;a better word
      than he himself knows... she's a truffler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gazing at him. &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what has struck you? Where's
      that humorous balance of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in earnest, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see. But why on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want you to marry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that the Worm's small courage fled utterly out of
      his inexperienced heart. And his tongue, as if to play a saturnine trick
      on that heart, repeated the phrase, unexpectedly to what was left of his
      brain, with an emphatic downward emphasis that closed the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to marry,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden moisture came to Sue's eyes, and much of the old frankness as she
      surveyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said then, &ldquo;you are wonderful, coming at me like this, as if
      you cared&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I feel it. Just when I thought friends were&mdash;well...&rdquo; She
      did not finish this, but sat erect, pushed her teacup aside and gazed at
      him with something of the old alertness in the green-brown eyes. There was
      sudden color in her cheeks. &ldquo;Henry, you've roused me&mdash;just when I
      thought no one could. I've got to think.... You go away. You don't mind,
      do you? Just let me be alone. I've felt lately as if I was losing&mdash;my
      mind, my will, my perceptions&mdash;something. And, Henry&mdash;wait!&rdquo; For
      he had risen, with a blank face, and was looking for his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;did Peter leave you his itinerary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm felt in his pockets and produced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sent me one, but I tore it up.&rdquo; She laughed a little, then colored
      with a nervous suddenness; and walked after him to the door. &ldquo;You've
      always had the faculty of rousing me, Henry, and steadying me. To-day
      you've stirred me more than you could possibly know. I don't know what
      will come of it&mdash;I'm dreadfully; confused&mdash;but I can at least
      try to think it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all&mdash;all but a few commonplace phrases at the doer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, with a touch of awkwardness, &ldquo;I meant to tell you that I've
      made a change myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; Again her eyes, recalled to him, ran over his new clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I start work to-morrow, on <i>The Evening Courier</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henry, I'm glad. Good luck! It ought to be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said he heavily, &ldquo;it will be a slight contact with reality,&rdquo;
       and hurried away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;ENTER GRACE DERRING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE TRUFFLER opened
      at Albany. Before ten o'clock of that first evening even the author knew
      that-something was wrong with the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company wandered across New York State into Pennsylvania; Peter, by
      day and night, rewriting that unhappy act. The famous producer, Max
      Neuerman, fat but tireless, called endless rehearsals. There was hot
      coffee at one a. m., more hot coffee at five A. m., but it was never so
      hot as the scalding tears of the leading lady, Miss Trevelyan, who
      couldn't, to save her, make Peter's lines come real.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There were, also, dingy Eagle Houses and Hotel Lincolns where soggy food
      was hurled at you in thick dishes by strong-armed waitresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Neuerman himself dictated a new scene that proved worse than any
      of Peter's. The publicity man submitted a new second-act curtain. The
      stage manager said that you couldn't blame Miss Trevelyan; she was an
      emotional actress, and should not be asked to convey the restraint of
      ironic comedy&mdash;in which belief he rewrote the act himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the second act had lost whatever threads of connecting
      interest it may have had with the first and third; so Neuerman suggested
      that Peter do those over. Peter began this&mdash;locked up over Sunday in
      a hotel room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Neuerman made this announcement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;got one more string to my bow. Trevelyan can't do your play,
      and she's not good enough to swing it on personality. We're going to try
      some one that can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, for instance?&rdquo; muttered Peter weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Derring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of Grace Derring. It was not a year since that tumultuous
      affair had brought Peter to the brink of self-destruction. And that not
      because of any coldness between them. Not exactly. You see&mdash;well,
      life gets complicated at times. You are not to think harshly of Peter; for
      your city bachelor does <i>not</i> inhabit a vacuum. There have usually
      been&mdash;well, episodes. Nor are you to feel surprise that Peter's face,
      in the space of a moment, assumed an appearance of something near helpless
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Grace Herring was to be whirled back into his life&mdash;caught up out
      of the nowhere, just as his devotion to Sue had touched exalted heights!
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the fat manager was humming in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made good for us in <i>The Buzzard</i>. Of course her work in <i>The
      Gold Heart</i> has put her price up. But she has the personality. I guess
      we've got to pay her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter started to protest, quite blindly. Then, telling himself that he was
      too tired to think (which was true), he subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get her?&rdquo; he asked cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's due here at five-thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter slipped away. Neuerman had acted without consulting him. It seemed
      to him that he should be angry. But he was merely dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked the streets, a solitary, rather elegant figure, conspicuously a
      New Yorker, swinging his stick savagely and occasionally muttering to
      himself. He roved out to the open country. Maple buds were sprouting. New
      grass was pushing upward into the soft air. The robins were singing. But
      there were neither buds nor robins in Peter's heart. He decided to be
      friendly with Grace, but reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly six when he entered the barnlike office of the hotel, his
      eyes on the floor, full of himself. Then he saw her, registering at the
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped short. He could not very well turn and go out. She might
      see him.. And he was not afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did see him. He raised his hat, Their hands met&mdash;he extremely
      dignified, she smiling a very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're looking well, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved, tacitly, into the adjoining parlor and stood by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think, Peter?&rdquo; Then, before he could reply, she went on to
      say: &ldquo;I've been working through the Middle West. Closed in Cincinnati last
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had a hard season?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard&mdash;yes.&rdquo; She glanced down at a large envelope held under her arm.
      &ldquo;Mr. Neuerman sent your play. I've just read it&mdash;on the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Again that hint of a smile. Peter's eyes wandered about the room.
      &ldquo;It's funny,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's funny?&rdquo; said he severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of this play.&rdquo; She took it out of the envelope and rapidly
      turned the typewritten pages. &ldquo;So bachelor women are&mdash;what you call
      'trufflers,' Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite impersonal, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course&mdash;a work of art&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not clear what that twisted little smile of hers meant, he kept silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter!&rdquo; she said then, and left him. Everything considered, he felt
      that he had handled it rather well.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Tuesday. It was arranged that Miss Derring should make her first
      appearance Thursday night. Meantime, she was to get up her part and watch
      the play closely with the idea of possible suggestions. Peter kept
      austerely aloof, working day and night on the revision of Acts I and III.
      Neuerman and Miss Derring consulted together a good deal. On Thursday,
      Peter caught them at the luncheon table, deep in a heap of scribbled
      sheets of paper that appeared to be in Grace's large hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They urged him to join them, but he shook his head. He did agree, however,
      to sit through the rehearsal, later in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that he found himself seated next to Grace in one of the rear
      rows of a dim empty theater, all but lost in the shadows under the
      balcony. Neuerman left them, and hurried down to the stage to pull his
      jaded company together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Peter that they were very close, he and Grace, there in the
      shadow. He could feel her sleeve against his arm. He wished Neuerman would
      come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly to himself, Peter started nervously. His hat slipped from his
      knees. He caught it. His hand brushed Grace's skirt, then her hand. Slowly
      their fingers interlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there, minute after minute, without a sound, her fingers tight in
      his. Then, suddenly, he threw an arm about her shoulders and tried to kiss
      her. With a quick little rustle, she pressed him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter leaned back and sat very still again, holding her hand down
      between the two seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the rehearsal was over. They evaded the manager and walked. There
      was a river in this town, and a river road. Peter sought it. And out there
      in the country, with buds and robins all about them and buds and robins in
      his heart, he kissed her. He knew that there had never been any woman in
      all the world but Grace, and told her so. All of his life except the hours
      he had spent with her faded into an unreal and remote dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace had something on her mind. But it was a long time before she could
      bring Peter to earth. Finally he bethought himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said&mdash;they were strolling hand in hand&mdash;&ldquo;here
      it is after seven! You've had no dinner&mdash;and you're going on
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, Peter. Not until Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Neuerman and I have been trying to explain what we were doing, but
      you wouldn't listen. Peter, I've made a lot of suggestions for the part,
      He asked me to. I want your approval, of course. I'm going to ask him to
      show you what I've done.&rdquo; But Peter heard only dimly. Near the hotel, she
      left him, saying, with a trace of anxiety: &ldquo;I don't want to see you again,
      Peter, until you have read it. Look me up for lunch to-morrow, and tell me
      if you think I've hurt your play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neuerman came to him late that night with a freshly typed manuscript. He
      tried to read it, but the buds and robins were still alive, the play a
      stale dead thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday morning, there was a letter for Peter, addressed in Sue's hand. The
      sight of it confused him, so that he put it in his pocket and did not open
      it until after his solitary breakfast. It had the effect of bringing Sue
      suddenly to life again in his heart without, at first, crowding Grace out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's love that is the great thing,&rdquo; he thought, explaining the phenomenon
      to himself. &ldquo;The object of it is an incident, after all. It may be this
      woman, or that&mdash;or both. But the creative artist must have love. It
      is his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he read Sue's letter; and pictures of her arose. It began to appear
      to him that Sue had inspired him as Grace never had. Perhaps it was Sue's
      youth. Grace, in her way, was as honest as Sue, but she was not so young.
      And the creative artist must have youth, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Could you, by any chance, run back to New York Saturday&mdash;have tea
      with me? I want you here. Come about four</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it fired his imagination. It was like Sue to reach out to him in that
      abrupt way, explaining nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he settled down in his room, a glow in his heart, to find out just
      what Grace and Neuerman had done, between! them, to <i>The Truffler</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon that day a white Peter, lips trembling, very still and stiff,
      knocked at Miss Derring's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened it, just dressed for luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he frigidly, &ldquo;is the manuscript of your play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, very wide, searched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not mine. I wash my hands of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter&mdash;please don't talk like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have chosen to enter into a conspiracy with Neuerman to wreck what
      little was left of my play. With Neuerman!&rdquo; He emphasized the name. &ldquo;I am
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Peter&mdash;be sensible. Come to lunch and we'll straighten this up
      in five minutes. Nothing is being forced on you. I was asked...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were brought here without my knowledge. And now&mdash;this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode away, leaving the manuscript in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there in the door, following him with bewildered eyes until he
      had disappeared around a turn in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, feeling strongly (if vaguely) that he had sacrificed everything for
      a principle, packed his suitcase, caught a train to Pittsburgh, and later,
      a sleeper for New York.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;THE WORM CONSIDERS LOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Z</span>ANIN came in
      quietly, for him; matter of fact; dropped his hat on the couch; stood with
      his hands in his pockets and looked down at Sue who was filling her
      alcohol lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sue,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's Saturday at four. I've kept my part of the
      agreement. You haven't had a word from me. But&rdquo;&mdash;and he did show
      feeling here&mdash;&ldquo;you are not to think that it has been easy. We've
      talked like sensible people, you and I, but I'm not sensible.&rdquo; Still she
      bent over the lamp. &ldquo;So you'd better tell me. Are we starting off together
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Sue. Now, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She straightened up. &ldquo;I'm not playing with you, Jacob. I promised to
      answer you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;why don't you? Now. Why wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't know yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But good God, Sue! If you don't know yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped into a chair; studied her gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the bell rang and Peter came in. And Sue faced two grave silent men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; she said, as briskly as she could, &ldquo;we shall have tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This much accomplished and the biscuits distributed, she curled herself up
      on the couch. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this has been a difficult week. And I can
      see only one thing to do. The Nature Film Company is in a bad way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the two men looked squarely at each other. Sue, her
      color up, a snap in her eyes, suppressed a perverse impulse to laugh, and
      steadied herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I've been worn out&mdash;no good for weeks.
      You men are fighting each other&mdash;oh, yes, you are!&mdash;and yet we
      three are the ones that have got to do it. Now, Jacob, you have hinted at
      new expenses, new money problems, to me. I want you to say it all to
      Peter. Every word. Wait, please! And, Peter, you have felt that Jacob was
      inclined to run wild. Say it to him.&rdquo; She wound up in a nervous little
      rush and stopped short as if a thought frightened&mdash;&ldquo;And as for me,
      it's not a question of what I will or won't do. I'm afraid, if we don't
      straighten things out, it's going to be a question what I shall be able to
      do. We must get all this&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;'on the carpet.'
      Please begin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank back, drew a long breath and watched them with eyes in which
      there was a curious nervous alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than Sue could have dreamed, it was a situation made to Peter's hand.
      Without a moment's warning she had called on him to play, in some small
      degree, the hero. She had given him the chance to be more of a hero than
      Zanin. His very soul glowed at the thought. Given an audience, Peter could
      be anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it turned out that just as Zanin gave an odd little snort, caught
      squarely between impatience and pride, Peter turned on him and said, very
      simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue is right, Zarin. We have been knifing each other. And I'm ashamed to
      say that I haven't even had the sense to see that it wasn't business.&rdquo; And
      he put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin hesitated a faint fraction of a second and took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Peter&mdash;sure now that he knew how the late J. P. Morgan must have
      felt about things, full of still wonder at himself and touched by the
      wistful thought that had he chosen differently in youth he might easily
      have become a master of men&mdash;hit on the compromise of giving full
      play to Zanin's genius for publicity, provided Zanin, for his part,
      submitted to a budget system of expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a pretty small budget, too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We've got to do it with
      brains, Zanin, as you did things at the Crossroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This settled, however, a silence fell. Each of the three knew that nothing
      had been settled. Sue, that quiet light in her eyes, watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, with her extraordinary lightness of body, she sprang to her
      feet. Peter, all nerves, gave a start. Zanin merely followed her with
      eyes.&mdash;heavy puzzled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue picked up the tea kettle. &ldquo;One of you&mdash;Peter&mdash;bring the
      tray!&rdquo; she commanded as she went out into the dark kitchenette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, with a leap almost like Sue's, followed. He could not see clearly
      out there, but he thought she was smiling as she set down the kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he whispered, still in the glow of his quiet heroism, &ldquo;I knew I
      loved you, but never before today did I realize how much.&rdquo; No one could
      have uttered the words with simpler dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood motionless, bending Over the kettle,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened to-day,&rdquo; she said very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue&mdash;nothing serious!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head now. She <i>was</i> smiling. &ldquo;How much do you want me,
      Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only offer you my life, Sue, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing&mdash;what if&mdash;I&mdash;were&mdash;to accept it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped away from his outstretched arms then, and back to the
      living-room. Peter, in a wordless ecstasy, followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; she said, without faltering. &ldquo;I want you to congratulate me.
      Peter and I are going to&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a little excited laugh now&mdash;&ldquo;to
      try marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm wandered into the Muscovy for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue and Peter caught him there just as he was paying Lis check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, not caring who might hear&mdash;&ldquo;we owe a lot to Henry.
      Perhaps everything. In that dreadful mood I wouldn't have listened to
      reason from any one else&mdash;never in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Worm,&rdquo; Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Looks like a little liquid refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Worm had to drink with them, but conviviality was not in his heart.
      He raised his glass; looked over it, grimly, at Peter. &ldquo;I drink,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;to Captain Miles Standish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter let it go as one of Henry Bates' quaint whimsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sue looked puzzled. And the Worm, suddenly contrite, got away and
      walked the streets, carrying with him a poignantly vivid picture of a
      fresh girlish face with high color and vivid green-brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he tried going home, weakly wishing he might find something
      to read; instead he found Hy Lowe and an extremely good-looking girl with
      mussed hair. They fairly leaped apart as he came stumbling in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're trying a new step,&rdquo; panted Hy quite wildly. &ldquo;Oh, yes, this is Miss
      Hilda Hansen&mdash;Henry Bates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm liked the way she blushed. But he suddenly and deeply hated Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm went out and sat on a bench in the Square. He was still sitting
      there when the moon came up over the half-clothed trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Italians from the dark streets to the southward played about the
      broad walks. Busses rumbled by on the central drive. A policeman passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full-breasted girls arm in arm with swarthy youthful escorts strolled
      past. One couple sat on his bench and kissed. He got up hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, rather late he stood, a lonely figure under the marble arch,
      gazing downward at his shoes, his stick, his well made, neatly pressed
      trousers. He took off his new hat and stared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman, passing, paused to take him in, then satisfied as to his
      harmlessness, moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy day, to-morrow,&rdquo; the Worm told himself irrelevantly. &ldquo;Better turn
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw another moon-touched couple approaching. He kept out of their
      sight. The man was Hy Lowe, dapper but earnest, clutching the arm of his
      very new Miss Hansen, bending close over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm watched until he lost them in the shadows of Waverley Place.
      Next, as if there were some connection, he stared down again at his own
      smart costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he informed himself, &ldquo;is an inflammation of the ego.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went home and to bed.

      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;BUSINESS INTERVENES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Worm met Sue
      Wilde one afternoon as she stepped down from a Seventh Avenue car&mdash;carried
      it off with a quite successful air of easy surprise. He couldn't see that
      it harmed Peter or anybody, for him to meet her now and then. If it gave
      him pleasure just to see her walk&mdash;even in a middy blouse, old skirt
      and sneakers, she was graceful as a Grecian youth!&mdash;to speak and then
      listen to her voice as she answered, to glimpse her profile and sense the
      tint of health on her olive skin, whose business was it! So long as he was
      asking nothing! Besides, Sue didn't dream. He didn't intend that she
      should dream. He had lied to her with shy delight regarding his set habit
      of walking every afternoon. He hated walks&mdash;hated all forms of
      exercise. He knew pretty accurately when she would be through her day's
      work at the plant of the Interstellar Film Company, over in Jersey,
      because they were doing outside locations now, and outdoor work, even in
      April, needs light. He knew precisely what trains she could catch; had,
      right now, a local time table in a convenient pocket. Sue was an outdoor
      girl and would prefer ferry to tube. From the ferry it was car or
      sidewalk; either way she couldn't escape him unless she headed elsewhere
      than toward her dingy little apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day he walked home with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suggested tea. He let his eyes dwell on her an instant&mdash;she on
      the top step, he just below&mdash;and in that instant he forgot Peter.
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, a pleasant glow in his breast, &ldquo;if you'll have
      dinner with me. They have a fresh lot of those deep-sea oysters at Jim's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught her hesitation and recalled Peter. For a moment they stood
      in silence, then: &ldquo;Don't let's trade,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come in for tea anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her in, reflecting. Peter or no Peter, it disturbed him to sec
      this restraint in Sue Wilde. He felt that it disturbed her a little, too.
      It was possible, of course, that this was one of the evenings when Peter
      expected to appropriate her. The Worm was the least obtrusive of men, but
      he could be stubborn. Then and there he asked if this was Peter's evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was stooping to unlock the apartment door. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied rather
      shortly, &ldquo;he's working tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had hardly got into the apartment before the bell rang, and Sue went
      out to answer it. The Worm, sandy of hair, mild of feature, dropped into
      the willow armchair, rested elbows on knees, surveyed the half-furnished
      living-room and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a mason jar on the mantel, next to a hit-or-miss row of Russian novels,
      Havelock Ellis's <i>Sex in Relation to Society, Freud on Dreams and
      Psychanalysis</i>, and two volumes of Schnitzler's plays, blazed a large
      cluster of jonquils. At the other end of the mantel, drooping over the rim
      of a green water pitcher, were dusty yellow roses, full blown, half their
      petals scattered on books, mantel and hearth, their scent heavy in his
      nostrils. A tin wash basin, on the mission table by the wall, was packed,
      smothered, with pansies&mdash;buff, yellow, orange, purple, velvet black.
      A bunch of violets surmounted an old sugar bowl that shared with cigarette
      boxes, matches and an ash receiver, the tabouret by the couch-bed. But
      what widened the Worm's faint smile into a forthright grin, square and
      huge on the table, towering over the pansies, was a newly opened
      five-pound box of sweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue came in, smiling herself, with a hint of the rueful, bearing before
      her a long parcel with square ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet it's roses,&rdquo; observed the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tore off the paper, opened the box with quick fingers&mdash;it <i>was</i>
      roses&mdash;deep red ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a chocolate, nibbled it; then stepped back, laughing a little and
      threw out her hands. &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what on earth am I to do with
      him! I've hinted. And I've begged. I'm afraid I'll hurt him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would go and get engaged to him, Sue. And I must say he plays the
      rôle with all his might.&rdquo; After which remark, the Worm produced, scraped,
      filled and lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll start the water,&rdquo; said Sue; then instead, stood gazing at the
      flowers. &ldquo;It's so&mdash;Victorian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm grinned cheerfully. &ldquo;Peter isn't so easy to classify as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She reached for another chocolate. &ldquo;He isn't Victorian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all the time, certainly. And not all over. Just in spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her color deepened slightly. &ldquo;You've never read the scenario he did for
      us, Henry. Nothing Victorian about that. There's a ring to it&mdash;and
      power. Nobody who misses the modern spirit <i>could</i> have written it.
      Not possibly. It's the real battle cry of woman's freedom. And a blow for
      honesty! It is when I think of that&mdash;how the pictures are to be shown
      in every city and every village, all over this country&mdash;reaching
      people that the books never reach and touching their emotions, yes, their
      hearts where feminist speakers and such just antagonize them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence died out in mid-air. Sue, a flash in her deep-green eyes,
      stared out the window at the old red brick walls that surrounded the score
      of fenced-in little back yards, walls pierced with hundreds of other rear
      windows and burdened with cluttered fire-escapes, walls hidden here and
      there by high-hung lines of washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke again. &ldquo;Don't you see, Henry, that's what makes this miserable
      business worth while, that's what justifies it&mdash;all this posing
      before those camera people, working with hired actors that don't for a
      moment know what it's all about and don't understand my being in it or my
      relations with Peter or the friendly feeling I have for Zanin&mdash;it's
      getting so I have to fight it out with myself all over again every morning
      to get through it at all. But when I'm almost hopelessly stale all I have
      to do is come home here and shut the door and curl up on the couch and
      read the thing as Peter wrote it&mdash;it brings the vision back, Henry!&mdash;and
      then I think of him staking all his savings to make it a success&mdash;Oh,
      I know that's personal, just for me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue was having some trouble with sentences today. This one didn't get
      finished either. She stood there brooding; started another one: &ldquo;Henry,
      Zanin couldn't do it&mdash;with all his intelligence and drive&mdash;it
      took Peter to phrase Zanin's own ideas and then add the real quality to
      them and form and human feeling&mdash;Zanin is cold, an intellectualist
      not an artist.&rdquo; Suddenly she broke out with this&mdash;&ldquo;Of course this
      marriage means a long series of adjustments. Do you suppose I don't know
      that? Doesn't every marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was silent; smoking slowly and watching her. He was thinking very
      soberly. &ldquo;Whom among women the gods would destroy they first make honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue felt his gaze and raised her chin with a little jerk; tried to smile;
      finally caught up the box of roses and buried her face in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter oughtn't to spend the money,&rdquo; she cried, not unhumorously, &ldquo;but it
      is dear of him. Every time I come into the room the flowers sing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said he, helping her out, &ldquo;it's a relief, in these parts, to
      see some one taking marriage seriously. Date set yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not telling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;That's all. No more questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religious ceremony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, Henry.&rdquo; She was a thought grim about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be as rationalistic as you like,&rdquo; said he, musing, &ldquo;but marriage
      <i>is</i> a fairy story. Like the old-fashioned Christmas with tree and
      candles and red bells&mdash;yes, and Santa Claus. You can't rationalise
      love, and you can't casualize it. Not without debasing it. Love isn't
      rational. It is exclusive, exacting, mysterious. It isn't even wholly
      selfish.&rdquo; His tone lightened. &ldquo;All of which is highly heterodox, here on
      Tenth Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly and busied herself over the teakettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to see that Zanin keeps friendly, Sue.&rdquo; She sobered, and said:
      &ldquo;There, it's boiling.&rdquo; The bell sounded again&mdash;two short rings, a
      pause, one long ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, bit her lip. &ldquo;That's Zanin now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He hasn't been
      here since&mdash;&rdquo; She moved toward the door, then hesitated. &ldquo;I wish you
      would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip again, then suddenly went. He heard the door open and
      heard her saying: &ldquo;Henry Bates is here. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin entered the room, and the Worm quietly considered him. The man had a
      vision. And he had power&mdash;unhindered by the inhibitions of the
      Anglo-Saxon conscience, undisciplined by the Latin instinct for form,
      self-freed from the grim shackles of his own ancestry. He wore a wrinkled
      suit, cotton shirt with rolling collar, his old gray sweater in lieu of
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank three cups of tea, chatted restively, drummed with big fingers on
      the chair-arm and finally looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm knocked the ashes from his pipe and considered. Just what did Sue
      wish he would do? No use glancing at her for further orders, for now she
      was avoiding his glances. He decided to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the sidewalk he stood for a moment hesitating between a sizable
      mess of those deep-sea bivalves at Jim's oyster bar and wandering back
      across Sixth Avenue and Washington Square to the rooms. It wasn't dinner
      time; but every hour is an hour with oysters, and Jim's was only a step.
      But then he knew that he didn't want to eat them alone. For one moment of
      pleasant self-forgetfulness he had pictured Sue sitting on the other side
      of the oysters. They went with Sue to-night, were dedicated to her. He
      considered this thought, becoming rather severe with himself, called it
      childish sentimentality; but he didn't go to Jim's. He went to the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone Zanin hitched forward in his chair and fixed his eyes on
      Sue over his teacup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Jacob?&rdquo; she asked, not facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasted no words. &ldquo;You know something of our business arrangements, Sue&mdash;Peter's
      and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a complication. When we formed The Nature Film Company we had, as
      assets, my ideas and energy and Peters money and theatrical experience.
      And we had you, of course. You were vital&mdash;I built the whole idea
      around your personality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she broke in with a touch of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter stood ready to put in not more than four to five thousand dollars.
      That was his outside figure. He told me that it was nearly all he had&mdash;and
      anyway that he is living on his capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; He put down his teacup and spread his hands in a sweeping
      gesture. &ldquo;Now for the rest of it. Of course we had no organization or
      equipment, so we made the deal with the Interstellar people. They took a
      third interest. They supply studio, properties, camera men, the use of
      their New Jersey place and actors and hand us a bill every week. Naturally
      since we got to work with all our people on the outside locations, the
      bills have been heavy&mdash;last week and this&mdash;especially this.
      Before we get through they'll be heavier.&rdquo; He drew a folded paper from his
      pocket; spread it out with a slap of a big hand; gave it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jacob,&rdquo; she faltered and caught her breath. &ldquo;Eight hundred and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;It's running into regular money. And here we are! Peter has
      put in three thousand already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More&mdash;about thirty-two hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jacob, at this rate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will the whole thing cost? My present estimate is twelve to fifteen
      thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue flushed with something near anger. &ldquo;This is new, Jacob! You said three
      or four thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. His face was impassive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was as new to me as to you. The situation is growing. We must grow
      with it. We've got a big idea. It has all our ideals in it, and it's going
      to be a practical success, besides. It's going to get across, Sue. We'll
      all make money. Real money. It'll seem queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue, eyes wide, was searching that mask of a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here's the difficulty. Peter isn't strong enough to swing it. Within
      another week we'll be past his limit&mdash;and we can't stop. <i>He</i>
      can't stop. Don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was pressing her hands against her temples. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, in a
      daze, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now.&rdquo; He found a cigarette on the tabouret; lighted it, squared
      around. &ldquo;The Interstellar people aren't fools. They know we're stuck.
      They've made us an offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the control?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;For the control, yes. But they leave us an interest. They'd
      have to or pay us good big salaries. You see, they're in, too. It means
      some sacrifice for us, but&mdash;oh, well, after all, 't means that the
      Nature Film has a value. They'll finance it and undertake the
      distribution. There's where we might have come a cropper anyway&mdash;the
      distribution. I've just begun to see that. You keep learning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trying to think. Even succeeding after a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; she said, very quiet, &ldquo;why do you bring this to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spread his hands. &ldquo;This is business, now. I'll be brutal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, lips compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Peter&mdash;you're to be married, the minute we get the picture
      done, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved at the flowers, stared grimly at the huge box of candy. &ldquo;Peter's
      an engaged man, an idiot. He's living in 1880. I'm the man who offered you
      love with freedom. Don't you realize that the time has come when Peter and
      I can't talk. It's the truth, Sue. You know it. You're the only human link
      between us. Therefore, I'm talking to you.&rdquo; He waited for her to reply;
      then as she was still, added this quite dispassionately: &ldquo;Better watch
      Peter, Sue. He's not standing up very well under the strain. I don't
      believe he's used to taking chances. Of course, when a nervous cautious
      man does decide to plunge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;I take it you're planning to go ahead, regardless,
      Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I've told you&mdash;we can't
      stop. Peter least of all. It's pure luck to us that the Interstellar folks
      can't stop either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;if they could&mdash;we'd...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fail? Certainly. Smash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue felt his strength; found herself admiring him, as she had admired him
      in the past&mdash;coldly, with her mind only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go to him as your messenger,&rdquo; she said, again partly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;if you won't! Call him&mdash;&rdquo; He waved toward the
      telephone. &ldquo;Is he home now?&rdquo; She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a partnership for him&mdash;a good offer&mdash;responsible people.
      See here, Sue, you must be made to grasp this. We're going straight on.
      Got to! The problem is to make Peter understand&mdash;the shape he's in,
      frightened to death... he won't listen to me.... It's up to you, Sue. It's
      a job to be handled. I'm trying to tell you. One way or another, it's got
      to be broken to him tonight. We've got precious little time to give him
      for his nervous upset before he comes around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue looked at him. Her hands were folded in her lap..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob, you shouldn't have come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't even call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up, moved toward the telephone, hesitated midway, changed his mind
      and picked up his hat. Holding it between his hands he stood over her. She
      waited. But instead of speaking, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there a brief time, thinking; went over to the telephone herself;
      even fingered the receiver; gave it up; busied herself hunting a
      receptacle for Peter's roses, finally settling on an earthenware crock.

      CHAPTER XX&mdash;PETER GETS A NOTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Worm walked
      slowly and thoughtfully across to Washington Square and the old brick
      apartment building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was there&mdash;a gloomy intense figure, bent over the desk at the
      farther end of the nearly dark studio, his long face, the three little
      pasteboard bank books before him, the pad on which he was figuring and his
      thin hands illuminated in the yellow circle from the drop light on the
      desk. Just behind him on the small table was his typewriter, and there
      were sheets of paper scattered on the floor. He lifted his face, peered at
      the Worm through his large glasses, then with nervous quickness threw the
      bank books into a drawer which he locked. He tore up the top sheet of the
      pad; noted pencil indentations on the sheet next under it, and tore that
      up too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he remarked listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; replied the Worm. Adding with a touch of self-consciousness:
      &ldquo;Just had a cup of tea with Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over at her place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any&mdash;any one else there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter winced and whitened a little about the mouth; then suddenly got up
      and with an exaggerated air of casualness set about picking up the papers
      on the floor. This done he strode to the window and stared out over the
      Square where hundreds of electric lights twinkled. Suddenly he swung
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a strain,&rdquo; he said in a suppressed, clouded voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; murmured the Worm, reaching for the evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin used to try to&mdash;to make love to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some effort must be made to stem this mounting current. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said
      the Worm, rather hurriedly, &ldquo;you're free from worry, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&mdash;if I were!&rdquo; muttered the eminent modernist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are! Good lord, man, here I've just asked her to have dinner with
      me, and she ducked. Wouldn't even eat with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing! It was flatly because she is engaged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter thought this over and brightened. &ldquo;But see here!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;I'm
      not a Turk. I'm not trying to lock her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter confronted him; spoke with vehemence. &ldquo;Sue is free&mdash;absolutely.
      I want her to be free. I wouldn't have it otherwise. Not for a moment.
      It's absurd that she should hesitate about dining with you, or&mdash;or&rdquo;&mdash;this
      with less assurance&mdash;&ldquo;with any man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter walked around the room, stopping again before the Worm who was now
      sitting on the desk, looking over the evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now!&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Put up that paper. Listen to me. Here you
      are, one of my oldest friends, and you make me out a Victorian monster
      with the woman I love. Damn it, man, you ought to know me better! And you
      ought to know Sue better. If her ideas are modern and free, mine are, if
      anything, freer. Yes, they are! In a sense&mdash;in a sense&mdash;I go
      farther than she does. She is marrying me because it is the thing she
      wants to do. That's the only possible basis on which I would accept her
      love. If that love ever dies&rdquo;.... Peter was suddenly all eloquence and
      heroism. Self-convinced, all afire, he stood there with upraised arm. And
      the Worm, rather fascinated, let his paper drop and watched the man... &ldquo;If
      that love ever dies,&rdquo; the impressive voice rang on, &ldquo;no matter what the
      circumstances, engaged, married, it absolutely does not matter, Sue is
      free. Good God! You should know better&mdash;you, of all people! You know
      me&mdash;do you suppose I would fasten on Sue, on that adorable, inspired
      girl, the shackles of an old-fashioned property marriage! Do you suppose I
      would have the hardihood to impose trammels on that free spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carried away by his own climax Peter whirled, snatched up the desk
      telephone, called Sue's number, waited tense as a statue for the first
      sound of her voice, then said, instantly assuming the caressingly gentle
      voice of the perfect lover: &ldquo;Sue, dear, hello! How are you? Tired? Oh, I'm
      sorry. Better get out somewhere. Wish I could come, but a job's a job.
      I'll stick it out. Wait though! Here's Henry Bates with nothing to do. I'm
      going to send him over to take you out&mdash;make you eat something and
      then walk a bit. It's what you need, little girl. No, not a word! I'm
      going to ring off now. He'll come right over. Good-by, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down the instrument, turned with an air of calm triumph. &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; he said commandingly. &ldquo;Run along. Take her to the Muscovy. I may
      possibly join you later but don't wait for me. I'll tell you right now,
      we're not going to have any more of this fool notion that Sue isn't free.&rdquo;
       With which he sat down at his typewriter and plunged into his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, taken aback, stared at him. Then, slowly, he smiled. He didn't
      care particularly about the Muscovy. It was too self-consciously
      &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;&mdash;too much like all the semi-amateur, short-lived little
      basement restaurants that succeed one another with some rapidity in the
      Greenwich Village section. The Worm was thinking again of Jim's
      exceedingly Anglo-Saxon chop house and of those salty deep-sea oysters,
      arrived this day. At the Muscovy you had Russian table-cloths and napkins.
      The tables were too small there, and set too close together. You couldn't
      talk. You couldn't think. He wondered if Peter hadn't chosen the place,
      thus arbitrarily, because Sue's friends would be there and would see her
      enacting this freedom of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was now pecking with a rather extraordinary show of energy at the
      typewriter. The Worm, studying him, noted that his body was rigidly erect
      and his forehead beaded with sweat, and began to realize that the man was
      in a distinct state of nerves. It was no good talking to him&mdash;not
      now. So, meekly but not unhumorously obeying orders, the Worm set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue met him at her door with a demure smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; she asked&mdash;&ldquo;Jim's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. His face, the tone of his voice, were impenetrable.
      There was not so much as a glimmer of mischief in his quietly expressive
      eyes; though Sue, knowing Henry Bates, looked there for it. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;we are to go to the Muscovy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, meanwhile, continued his frenzy of work for a quarter-hour; then
      slackened; finally stopped, sighed, ran his long fingers through his hair,
      and gloomy again, turned wearily around to the desk, unlocked his own
      particular drawer, brought out the three bank books and resumed his
      figuring on the pad. If you could have looked over his shoulder you would
      have seen that his pencil faltered; that he added one column, slowly and
      laboriously, six or seven times, getting a different result each time; and
      that then, instead of keeping at it or even throwing the book back into
      the drawer, he fell to marking over the figures, shading the down strokes,
      elaborating the dollar signs, enclosing the whole column within a
      two-lined box and then placing carefully-rounded dots in rows between the
      double lines. This done, he lowered his head and sighted, to see if the
      rows were straight. They were not satisfactory. He hunted through the top
      drawers and then on the bookcase for an eraser....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, caught his breath, then sank back, limp and white, in his
      chair. At the third knocking he managed to get up and go to the door. It
      was a messenger boy with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter held the envelope down in the little circle of yellow light on the
      desk. It was addressed in Zarin's loose scrawl. The handwriting definitely
      affected him. It seemed to touch a region of his nervous system that had
      been worn quiveringly raw of late. He tore the envelope open and unfolded
      the enclosure. There were two papers pinned together. The top paper was a
      bill from the Interstellar people for eight hundred and twenty dollars and
      fifty cents. The other was in Zanin's hand&mdash;penciled; &ldquo;It's getting
      beyond us, Mann. They offer to carry it through for a sixty per cent,
      interest. It's a good offer. We've got to take it. Come over to the
      Muscovy about eight, and I'll have copies of the contract they offer.
      Don't delay, or the work will stop to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter carefully unpinned the two papers, laid them side by side on the
      desk, smoothed them with his hands. Doing this, lie looked at his hands.
      The right one he raised, held it out, watched it. It trembled. He then
      experimented with the left. That trembled, too. He stood irresolute;
      opened the three savings bank books&mdash;spread them beside the papers;
      stared at the collection long and steadily until it began to exert a
      hypnotic effect on his unresponsive mind. He finally stopped this; stood
      up; stared at the Wall. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; ran his thoughts, &ldquo;I seem to be fairly
      calm. Perhaps as a creative artist, I shall gain something from the
      experience. I shall see how men act in utter catastrophe. Come to think of
      it, very few artists ever see a business failure at short range. This, of
      course, borders <i>on</i> tragedy. I am done for. But from the way I am
      taking this now I believe I shall continue to be calm. I must tell Sue, of
      course... it may make a difference.... I think I shall take one stiff
      drink. But no more. Trust the one. It will steady my nerves. And I won't
      look at those things any longer. After the drink I think I shall take a
      walk. And I shall be deliberate. I shall simply think it out, make my
      decision and abide by it.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;OYSTERS AT JIM'S
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UE and the Worm
      had no more than seated themselves at the Muscovy when Zanin came briskly
      in, hat in hand&mdash;still in the wrinkled old suit, still wearing the
      gray sweater for a waistcoat&mdash;but keen of face, buoyant even. He
      threaded his way between the tables, nodding here and there in response to
      the cries of &ldquo;Hello, Jacob!&rdquo;&mdash;came straight to Sue, and, with a
      casual greeting for the Worm, bent over and claimed her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he said low; &ldquo;I called up, then took a chance on finding you here.
      I've sent the bill to Peter. And I've told him of the break in our plans.
      The lawyer for the Interstellar people is coming with the new contract&mdash;meets
      me up-stairs in the club. I've told Peter to be here at eight. But I've
      got to know about you. Is there any danger that you won't go through&mdash;finish
      the pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;in case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;If Peter and I smash up. Whatever happens. I can't see ahead
      myself. But the pictures are half done, and they're all you. It would be
      serious if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue silenced him with a nervous glance about; compressed her lips; turned
      her fork over and over on the table; then slowly nodded. &ldquo;I'll finish,&rdquo;
       she said very soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I knew you would, of course. But I had to ask.
      Things have changed so.... I'll be down later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue watched him, still turning the fork with tense fingers, as he made his
      way to the door, paused for a word with one of the girl waitresses&mdash;an
      impoverished young writer and idealist, Jewish, rather pretty, who had
      played with them at the Crossroads&mdash;and finally disappeared in the
      hall, turning back toward the stairway that led up to the rooms of the
      Free woman's Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was studying the menu. He waited until her eyes and her thoughts
      returned to the table, then looked up at her with a quiet grin. &ldquo;How about
      food, Sue?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, collected her thoughts, looked down at the card. Then
      she made an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Henry&mdash;I've lost my appetite.&rdquo; She pressed the edge of the
      card against her pursed lips. &ldquo;Henry, let's get out&mdash;go over to
      Jim's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;We can't,&rdquo; he said. Then he saw her gaze narrow
      intently, over his shoulder&mdash;so intently that he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was standing in the doorway, peering about the room&mdash;a
      repressed, elaborately self-contained Peter. His mouth drooped at the
      corners. The lines that extended downward from his nose were deeper than
      usual, had something the appearance of being carved in a gray marble face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's gaze&mdash;he seemed to find it difficult to focus his eyes, was
      laborious about it&mdash;finally rested on their table. Slowly he got
      through the crowd, approaching them. He jostled one of the girl waiters;
      and turning, apologized with rather extraordinary formality. The girl
      glanced after him, curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm looked around, perceived an unoccupied chair at a neighboring
      table, lifted it over the heads of his neighbors and set it down beside
      his own. Peter dropped into it, saying, &ldquo;I'm sorry to disturb you two...
      something has come up.&rdquo; The Worm found it rather uncomfortable. His first
      impulse was to withdraw and let Peter and Sue talk. But people were
      looking at them; there were audible whispers; he decided to do nothing
      conspicuous. He sat back in his chair and studied the menu again. &ldquo;I'll
      know the thing by heart pretty soon!&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned forward, toward Sue. She was watching him calmly, the Worm
      thought; but she was a little hushed. There was no escaping the
      conversation that followed. Peter managed to keep his voice fairly low;
      but it was plain that he barely realized where he was. The whole engine of
      his mind&mdash;racing now at several thousand R. P. M.&mdash;was headed
      inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to quit the pictures, Sue, dear. I can't tell you the whole
      story now&mdash;not here&mdash;but Zanin has absolutely broken faith. He
      has wrecked me... not that I mind that... it's the crookedness of the
      thing... the ideals he professed... he's sold us out, it's a dirty
      commercial scheme after all that he's dragged you into.&rdquo;... The inner
      pressures were evident now in Peter's voice. It was still low, but it
      shook and came out jerkily and huskily. He was stopping frequently to
      swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue's fingers strayed toward the fork; turned it slowly. Her eyes followed
      her fingers. A waitress came toward them, stood unnoticed and turned away,
      exchanging an amused glance with friends at the next table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a complete smash,&rdquo; Peter went on. &ldquo;Any way you look at it, it's a
      smash. There's just that last step to take&mdash;we must get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo; Sue murmured, &ldquo;not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, Peter. We can talk later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's nothing to say.&rdquo; Now the Worm caught in his voice Peter's
      uncertainty of her. &ldquo;Is there, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and turned the fork. Peter's eyes were fastened on her face,
      hungrily, abjectly. She slowly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sue, you and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath, faced him. &ldquo;I've got to finish the pictures,
      Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue, you can't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply won't talk about this out here. But it would wreck Jacob if I
      stopped now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to the Worm that Peter had to make a desperate effort to
      comprehend this. His brows were knit, his eyes wandering. Finally he said:
      &ldquo;But, Sue, good God! You don't understand. Zanin has wrecked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure about that. If we finish the pictures. If we don't&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's hands gripped the edge of the table. &ldquo;Sue&mdash;Zanin has been
      talking with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Peter&mdash;not so loud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he? Answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you playing fair with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter&mdash;yes! I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still engaged to be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Please, Peter....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;the moment Henry Bates had shrewdly, painfully waited as he
      watched the man, came now; the suppressions that had been struggling
      within Peter's breast broke bounds; his voice suddenly rang out&mdash;&ldquo;then,
      I forbid you to go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue paled; seemed to sink down a little in her chair; knit her brows; said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was very still. Even the Greenwich Village group was startled,
      hushed, by the queer sense of impending drama that filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long hush several girls went out, hurriedly. Others struggled
      unsuccessfully to make talk. One laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked around with half-hearted defiance, then dropped his eyes.
      &ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; he said, addressing the Worm with queer precise formality,
      &ldquo;the thing for me to do is to go. I am not desired here.&rdquo; But he sat
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Zanin came in. He saw Peter, crowded bruskly
      across the room, laid a legal appearing document on the table at Peter's
      elbow and said: &ldquo;Look this over, Peter, and meet me up-stairs a little
      later. Their man is coming. They give us no choice&mdash;we must sign
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter squared around at the first tones of the strong, slightly husky
      voice, drew in his chin, scowled. It appeared to the Worm that he was
      making a desperate effort to look dignified. But at the last words, Zanin
      dropped a large hand on Peter's shoulder. That was what made the tremble;
      or rather what set it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have explained that the Muscovy occupied a basement. The ceiling was
      low. The tables&mdash;small ones around the walls and two longer ones
      across the center space with their chairs (common kitchen chairs, they
      were) filled the room except for an opening near the door. In the opening,
      at one side of the door, was the small table that served as a cashier's
      desk. It was covered with slips of paper and little heaps of coin and some
      bank notes under an iron paper-weight. The whole in charge of a meek girl
      with big spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were twenty-five or thirty persons in the room&mdash;mostly women
      and girls. Of the four or five men, two, in a party near the door, were
      painters with soft curling beards; the others, young anarchists and
      talkers, were seated over in the farther corner near one of the barred
      front windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feature of the scene that Henry Bates will never forget was that Peter
      first rose, very deliberately, produced an eye-glass case from an inner
      pocket and carefully put his glasses away. Then he sprang at Zanin&mdash;apparently
      not striking cleanly with clenched fists but clawing and slapping, and
      shouting breathlessly. I suppose that in every man who has been a boy and
      a youth there is a strain of vulgarity, innate or acquired. It is
      exhibited when reason flees. Reason had certainly, at last, fled from
      Peter. For what he was shouting was this&mdash;&mdash;over and over&mdash;&ldquo;A
      Jew won't fight! A Jew won't fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the surprise of this first rush Zanin retreated, sparring
      ineffectually; backed into the corner of a table; crashed over it; went
      down with it to the floor amid broken dishes, steaming food and the
      wreckage of a chair. Two young women were thrown also. One of them
      screamed; the other appeared to be stunned, and the Worm somehow got to
      her, lifted her up and supported her out the service door to the kitchen.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      When he returned the panic was on. Gasping and shrieking, various hitherto
      calm young women whom nothing in life could surprise, were fighting past
      one another for the door. But one young man, pasty-faced, longish hair&mdash;name
      of Waters Coryell&mdash;went through the struggling group like a thin
      tornado, tearing aside the women that blocked his way, symbolizing, in a
      magnificent burst of unselfconscious energy, the instinct of
      self-preservation, with a subconscious eye, doubtless to later
      achievements in self-expression.... The Worm saw his flight and smiled. He
      had heard Waters Coryell expound the doctrine that a man should do what he
      wants to do. &ldquo;He wants to get out,&rdquo; mused the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not at once leap upon the fallen Zanin. He first cast about for
      a weapon. At Sue's elbow was a large water pitcher. He seized this and for
      a moment stood over his opponent, blandishing it and again shouting, &ldquo;A
      Jew won't fight!&rdquo; He was in this attitude when the Worm returned from the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was nearly empty now. Over at the door, the meek little cashier
      with the big spectacles was calling out in a sharp small voice, &ldquo;Pay your
      checks, please! Pay your checks!&rdquo; And one girl, her eyes glassy with
      fright, automatically responding to the suggestion, was fumbling in her
      wrist bag, saying, &ldquo;I don't seem to have the change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm hesitated for a moment between getting Sue out and trying to stop
      the fight. Sue had pushed back her chair a little way but was still
      sitting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Zanin, who was trying to draw himself away on his elbows to
      a point where he could get up in reasonable safety, saw an opportunity to
      trip Peter. Instantly he put the idea into effect. Peter went down. The
      water pitcher was shattered on the floor. The two men clinched and rolled
      over and over among the chairs and against the legs of another table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm turned to Sue. &ldquo;You'd better get out,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite white. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she managed to say, &ldquo;I'm no use here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her arm and steadied her until she was clear of the wreckage.
      Every one else had got out now excepting the girl with the big spectacles.
      She stood flattened against the wall, apparently all but unable to
      breathe. As Sue Wilde passed, however, she gasped out, &ldquo;Check, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm snorted, caught Sue's arm again and rushed her out and up the
      steps to the sidewalk. Out here most of those who had been in the basement
      stood about in groups. Others, street children and loungers, were
      appearing. The situation was ripening swiftly into a street crowd with its
      inevitable climax of police interference. &ldquo;Move away!&rdquo; said the Worm to
      Sue. &ldquo;As far as the Square.&rdquo; And he spoke to others whom he knew. The
      crowd thinned. Then making a wry face in the dim light, the Worm headed
      back down the steps, muttering, &ldquo;Physical prowess is not my specialty,
      but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carefully shut the street door after him and turned the key. The little
      cashier was on the stairs now, crouching low against the wall. The Worm
      half listened for a &ldquo;Check, please!&rdquo; as he came down the corridor; but she
      was silent. There was, too, a suspicious, silence in the dining-room. The
      Worm hurried to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, just within the door, stood Peter. His right coat sleeve had been
      ripped nearly off, at the shoulder seam, and hung down over his hand. He
      was fumbling at it with the left hand, frantically trying, first to roll
      it back, then to tear it off. Zanin, over against the farther wall, was
      getting heavily to his feet. He paused only an instant, then charged
      straight at Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance at the eminent playwright made it plain that his frenzy already
      was tempered with concern. He had made, it appeared, a vital
      miscalculation. This particular Jew <i>would</i> fight&mdash;was,
      apparently, only just beginning to fight. There was blood on Zanin's
      cheek, trickling slowly down from a cut just under the eye. His clothes,
      like Peter's, were covered with the dirt of the floor. His eyes were
      savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter again groped blindly for a weapon. His hand, ranging over the
      cashier's table, closed on the iron paper-weight. He threw it at the
      onrushing Zanin, missed his head by an inch; caught desperately at a neat
      little pile of silver quarters; threw these; then Zanin struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was no longer a comedy. Zanin, a turbulent hulk of a man, was
      roused and dangerous. The Worm caught his arm and shoulder, shouted at
      him, tried to wrench the two apart. Zanin threw him off with such force
      that his head struck hard against the wall. The Worm saw stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fighters reeled, locked together, back into the dining-room, knocked
      over the cashier's table and fell on it. Zanin gave a groan of pain and
      closed his big hands on Peter's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm ran up the stairs. Three men were sitting, very quiet, in the
      reading-room of the Free-woman's Club. Waters Coryell dominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake,&rdquo; said the Worm quietly, &ldquo;come down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waters Coryell, who professed anarchism, surveyed him coolly. &ldquo;The thing
      to do,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;obviously, is to telephone the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone your aunt!&rdquo; said the Worm, and ran back down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Zanin were still on the floor, at grips. But their strength
      seemed to have flagged. One fact, noted with relief, was that Zanin had
      not yet choked Peter to death. They were both purple of face; breathing
      hard; staring at each other. Some of Zanin's still trickling blood had
      transferred itself to Peter's face and mixed with the dirt there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm caught up a chair, swung it over his head and cried, in deadly
      earnest, &ldquo;You two get up or I'll smash both your heads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They glared at each other for a moment. Then Zanin managed to catch enough
      breath to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man's insane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gulped. &ldquo;I am not insane! Nothing of the kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; commanded the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly, eying each other, they obeyed. Zanin brushed off his clothes
      as well as he could with his hands; then, for the first time conscious of
      the blood on his face, mopped at it with his handkerchief. Peter went off
      under the low-hanging center chandelier and examined with a pained
      expression, his ruined coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were steps and voices on the stairs. She of the big spectacles
      appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; observed Peter with breathless formality, &ldquo;but have
      you got a pin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him; then at Zanin, finally at the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a gentleman up-stairs,&rdquo; she said mechanically in a lifeless
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm went up. A businesslike young man was standing in the upper hall,
      looking about him with mild curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you wish to see?&rdquo; asked the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Zanin and Mr. Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you must be the attorney for the Interstellar people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said the Worm with calm, and ushered him down the stairs
      and into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue was sitting alone on a bench in Washington Square. She saw Henry Bates
      approaching and rose hurriedly to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over,&rdquo; said he cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Henry&mdash;tell me&mdash;what on earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No particular damage beyond what court plaster and Peter's tailor can fix
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;-how is it over so soon? What are they doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left, Zanin was entertaining that attorney chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down on his hands and knees trying to find the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he&mdash;will he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign it? Yes. They want you to sign, too. But I told them you'd do it in
      the morning. You're to have a ten per cent, interest&mdash;Zanin and Peter
      each fifteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May as well take it. You've earned it.... Look here, Sue, has it occurred
      to you that we&mdash;you and I&mdash;haven't had a morsel to eat yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started in genuine surprise; looked up at him with an intent
      expression that he could not, at the moment, fathom; then suddenly threw
      back her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry',&rdquo; she said, a ring in her voice, &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm not engaged any more&mdash;not
      to anybody! I want&mdash;&rdquo; she gave a slow little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;some
      oysters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Jim's!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped his arm through hers. Free-hearted as the birds that slumbered
      in the trees overhead they strolled over to the congenial oyster bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed The Nature Film Producing Co., Inc., Jacob Zanin, Pres't.

      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;A BACHELOR AT LARGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU are to picture
      Washington Square at the beginning of June. Very early in the morning&mdash;to
      be accurate, eight-fifty. Without the old bachelor apartment building,
      fresh green trees, air steaming and quivering with radiation and
      evaporation from warm wet asphalt, rumbling autobusses, endless streams of
      men and girls hurrying eastward and northward to the day's work or turning
      into the commercial-looking University building at our right, and hard at
      it, the inevitable hurdy gurdy; within, seventh floor front, large dim
      studio, Hy Lowe buttoning his collar and singing lustily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I want si-<i>imp</i>-athee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Si-<i>imp</i>-athee, just <i>symp</i>-ah-thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The collar buttoned, Hy, still roaring, clasped an imaginary partner to
      his breast and deftly executed the bafflingly simple step of the
      hesitation waltz over which New York was at the moment, as Hy would put
      it, dippy. Hy's eyes were heavy and red and decorated with the dark
      circles of tradition, but his feet moved lightly, blithely. Hy could dance
      on his own tombstone&mdash;and he would dance well.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of the two front windows Henry Bates, of <i>The Courier</i>,
      otherwise the Worm, in striped, buttonless pajamas caught across the chest
      with a safety-pin, gazed down at the Square while feeling absently along
      the sill for the cream bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third member of our little group of bachelors, Peter Ericson Mann, was
      away; down at Atlantic City, working on something. Also nursing a broken
      heart. For everybody knew now that he and Sue Wilde were not to be
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desk served as breakfast table; an old newspaper as cloth. There were
      flaked cereal in bowls, coffee from the percolator on the bookcase, rolls
      from a paper sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm lingered over his coffee. Hy gulped his, glancing frequently at
      his watch, propped against the inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; observed the Worm, pausing in his task of cleaning his pipe with a
      letter opener, &ldquo;I nearly forgot. A lady called up. While you were in the
      hath tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning?&rdquo; Hy's face went discreetly blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;sounded like Banana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Sorana.&rdquo; Hy's eyelids fluttered an instant. Then he lit a cigarette
      and was again his lightly imperturbable self. &ldquo;What an ungodly hour!&rdquo; he
      murmured, &ldquo;for Silvia, of all girls. But she knows she mustn't call me at
      the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm regarded his roommate with discerning, mildly humorous eyes.
      &ldquo;Who, may I ask, is Silvia? And what is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy missed the allusion. &ldquo;If <i>The Evening Earth</i> were ever to come
      into possession of my recent letters which I devoutly hope and trust they
      won't&rdquo;&mdash;Hy staged a shudder&mdash;&ldquo;they would undoubtedly refer to
      her as 'an actress.' Just like that. An actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; mused the Worm, &ldquo;it's in writing already, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The old world has to go round,&rdquo; said he. Then
      his eyes grew dreamy. &ldquo;But, my boy, my boy! You should see her&mdash;the
      darling of the gods! Absolutely the darling of the gods! Met her at the
      Grand Roof. Good lord! figured in cold calendar arithmetic, it isn't eight
      days. But then, they say eternity is but a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dancing case?&rdquo; queried the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy nodded. &ldquo;After ten steps, my son, we knew! Absolutely knew! She knew. I
      knew. We were helpless&mdash;it had to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Hy pocketed his watch and settled back to smoke comfortably.
      He always bolted his breakfast by the watch; he always chatted or read the
      paper afterward; he was always late at the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was studying him quizzically. &ldquo;Hy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; queried Hy, struggling with a smile of self-conscious elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! You know. This!&rdquo; The Worm gestured inclusively with his pipe.
      &ldquo;Ten days ago it was that Hilda Hansen person from Wisconsin. Two weeks
      before that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy raised his hand. &ldquo;Go easy with the dead past, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm pressed on. &ldquo;Morally, ethically, you are doubtless open to
      criticism. As are the rest of us. That is neither here nor there. What I
      want to know is, how do you do it? You're not beautiful. You're not witty&mdash;though
      the younger among 'em might think you were, for the first few hours. But
      the ladies, God bless 'em!&mdash;overlooking many men of character and
      charm, overlooking even myself&mdash;come after you by platoons,
      regiments, brigades. They fairly break in your door. What is it? How do
      you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a gift,&rdquo; said Hy cheerily, &ldquo;plus experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was slowly shaking his head. &ldquo;It's not experience,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;That's a factor, but that's not it. You hit it the first time. It's a
      gift&mdash;perhaps plus eyelashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my boy, I sometimes fail. Take the case you were about to mention&mdash;Betty
      Deane. I regard Betty as my most notable miscalculation&mdash;my
      Dardanelles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a minute, Hy. As I've heard the story, Betty was afraid of you,
      ran away, married in a panic. She, a self-expresser of the
      self-expressers, a seeker of the Newest Freedom, marries a small
      standpatter who makes gas engines. To escape your hypnotic influence. No&mdash;I
      can't concede it. That, sir, was a tribute to your prowess, no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy assumed an expression of modesty. &ldquo;If you know all about it, why ask
      me? I don't know. A man like me, reasonably young, reasonably hardworking,
      reasonably susceptible&mdash;well, good lord! I need the feminine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not puzzled about the demand,&rdquo; said the Worm, &ldquo;but the supply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! There aren't so many. I did have that little flare-tip with
      Betty. She promised to go away with me on the night boat. She didn't turn
      up; I took that trip alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It got as far as that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did. Whatever her reasons she skipped back to her home town and
      married the maker of gas engines. The Hilda Hansen matter caught me on the
      rebound. There couldn't ever have been anything in that, anyway. The
      girl's a leaner. Hasn't even a protective crust. Some kind uncle ought to
      take her and her little wall-paper designs back to Wisconsin. But this is&mdash;different!&rdquo;
       He fumbled rather excitedly in his pocket and produced a letter&mdash;pages
      and pages of it, closely written m a nervous hand that was distinguished
      mainly by unusually heavy down strokes of a stub pen. He glanced eagerly
      through it, coloring as his eyes fell on this phrase and that. &ldquo;You know,
      I'd almost like to read you a little of it. Damn it, the girl's got
      something&mdash;courage, fire, personality! She's perfectly wild&mdash;a
      pagan woman! She's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm raised an arresting pipe. &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;Never do that!
      Besides, your defense, while fairly plausible, accounts for only about
      three months of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slightly crestfallen, Hy read on in silence. Then he turned back and
      started at the beginning. Finally, looking up and catching the Worm's
      interested, critical eyes on him, he stuffed the document back into his
      pocket, lit a new cigarette, got up, found his hat and stick, stood a
      moment in moody silence, sighed deeply and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone rang. As the Worm drew the instrument toward him and lifted
      the receiver the door opened and Hy came charging back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was feminine. &ldquo;Is Mr. Lowe there?&rdquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme that phone!&rdquo; breathed Hy, reaching for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm swung out of his reach. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said into the transmitter, &ldquo;he's
      gone out. Just a moment ago. Would you like to leave any message?&rdquo; And
      dodging behind the desk, he grinned at Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That young man was speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did you say?&rdquo; Thus the Worm into the telephone. &ldquo;Mrs. Bixbee?&rdquo; He
      spoke swiftly to Hy. &ldquo;It's funny. I've heard the voice. But Mrs. Bixbee!&rdquo;
       Then into the telephone. &ldquo;Yes, this is Mr. Bates. Oh, you were Betty
      Deane? Yes, indeed! Wait a moment. I think he has just come in again. I'll
      call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that name Hy bolted. The door slammed after him. The Worm could
      hear him running along the outer corridor and down the stairs. He had not
      stopped to ring for the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Worm now unblushingly, &ldquo;I was mistaken. He isn't here. That
      was the floor maid.&rdquo; As he pushed the instrument back on the desk, he
      sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; he said aloud, with humility.
      &ldquo;It's a gift.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE BUZZER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EW YORK, as much
      as Paris or Peking, is the city of bizarre contrasts. One such is modestly
      illustrated in the life of Hy Lowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy hurried on this as on every working morning eastward across Broadway
      and through Astor Place to the large five-story structure, a block in
      length, near the heart of the Bowery, that had been known for seventy
      years as Scripture House. Tract societies clustered within the brownstone
      walls, publishers of hymn books and testaments, lecture bureaus, church
      extension groups, temperance and anti-cigarette societies, firms of lady
      typists, and with these, flocks of shorter-lived concerns whose literature
      was pious and whose aims were profoundly commercial. Long years before,
      when men wore beavers and stocks and women wore hoopskirts, the building
      had symbolized the organized evangelical forces that were to galvanize and
      remake a corrupt world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the world had somehow evaded this particular galvanizing process. It
      had plunged wildly on the little heretical matter of applied science;
      which in its turn had invaded the building in the form of electric light
      and power and creakily insecure elevators. The Trusts had come, and Labor
      Unions and Economic Determinism&mdash;even the I. W, W. and the mad
      Nietzschean propaganda of the Greenwich Village New Russianists. Not to
      mention War. Life had twisted itself into puzzling shapes. New York had
      followed farther and farther up-town its elevated roads, subways,
      steel-built sky-scrapers and amazing palaces of liquors and lobsters,
      leaving the old building not even the scant privilege of dominating the
      slums and factories that had crept gradually to and around it. And now as
      a last negligent insult, a very new generation&mdash;a confused generation
      of Jews, Italians, Irish, Poles, Slavs, serving as bookkeepers,
      stenographers, messengers, door girls, elevator boys&mdash;idled and
      flirted and enacted their little worldly comedies and tragedies within the
      very walls of Scripture House&mdash;practised a furtive dance step or two
      in the dim stock rooms, dreamed of broiled lobsters (even of liquors)
      while patient men with white string neckties and routine minds sat in
      inner offices and continued the traditional effort to remake that
      forgotten old world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the vision had failed, many a successful enterprise, then and now,
      thrived under the cover of Scripture House. One had thrived there for
      thirty years&mdash;the independent missionary weekly known to you as <i>My
      Brother's Keeper</i>. This publication was the &ldquo;meal ticket&rdquo; to which Hy,
      at rare intervals, referred. On the ground glass of his office door were
      the words, lettered in black, &ldquo;Assistant Editor.&rdquo; To this altitude had
      eight years of reporting and editing elevated Hy Lowe. The compensating
      honorarium was forty-five dollars a week. Not a great amount for one whose
      nature demanded correct clothing, Broadway dinners, pretty girls and an
      occasional taxicab; still a bachelor who lives inexpensively as to rooms,
      breakfasts and lunches and is not too hard on his clothes can go
      reasonably far on forty-five dollars, even in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this as on other mornings Hy, after a smile and a wink for the
      noticeably pretty little telephone girl in the outer office, slid along
      the inner corridor dose to the wood and glass partition. Though the
      Walrus' open doorway dominated the corridor, there was always a chance of
      slipping in unnoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened and closed his own door very softly; whipped off and hung up his
      street coat; donned the old black alpaca that was curiously bronzed from
      the pockets down by thousands of wipings of purple ink: and within twenty
      seconds was seated at his desk going through the morning's mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A buzzer sounded&mdash;on the partition just above his head. Hy started;
      turned and stared at the innocent little electrical machine. His color
      mounted. He compressed his lips. He picked up the editorial shears and
      deliberately slipped one blade under the insulated wires that led away
      from the buzzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the sound! Hy's fingers relaxed. He snorted, tossed the shears on
      the desk, strode to the door, paused to compose his features; then wearing
      the blankly innocent expression that meant forty-five dollars a week,
      walked quietly into the big room at the end of the corridor where, behind
      a flat mahogany desk seven feet square, sat the Reverend Hubbell Harkness
      Wilde, D. D.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall behind him lettered in gold leaf on black enamel, hung the
      apothegm (not from the eloquent pen of Doctor Wilde)&mdash;&ldquo;It is more
      blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo; Beneath, in a long mahogany bookcase,
      were hundreds of volumes, every one inserted in gratitude and admiration
      to the editor of <i>My Brothers Keeper</i>. The great desk was heaped with
      books, manuscripts, folders of correspondence. Beside it, pencil warily
      poised, sat Miss Hardwick, who for more than twenty years had followed
      Doctor Wilde about these offices&mdash;during most of every working day
      taking down his most trivial utterances, every word, to be transcribed
      later on the typewriter by her three six-dollar-a-week girls. It was from
      the resulting mass of verbiage that Miss Hardwick and the doctor dug out
      and arranged the weekly sermon-editorials that you read when you were a
      Sunday-school pupil and that your non-citified aunts and uncles are
      reading in book form to this day. They were a force, these sermons. Make
      no mistake about that! They had a sensational vigor that you rarely heard
      from the formal pulpit. The back-cover announcements of feature-sermons to
      come were stirring in themselves. If your mind be &ldquo;practical,&rdquo; scorning
      all mystical theorizings, let me pass on to you the inside information
      that through sermons and advertisements of sermons and sensational
      full-page appeals in display type this man whom Hy light-mindedly
      dismissed with the title of &ldquo;the Walrus&rdquo; had collected more than two
      million dollars in twenty years for those mission stations of his in
      Africa or Madagascar (or whenever they were). That is slightly upward of a
      hundred thousand a year in actual money, as a net average!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have had a momentary glimpse of Doctor Wilde. That was at the
      Crossroads Theater, where his runaway daughter was playing a boy in Jacob
      Zanin's playlet, <i>Any Street</i>. But the Walrus was then out of his
      proper setting&mdash;was merely a grim hint of a forgotten Puritanism in
      that little Bohemian world of experimental compliance with the Freudian
      Wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see him in his proper setting here. The old-fashioned woodcut of him
      that was always in the upper left corner of sermon or announcement was
      made in 1886&mdash;-that square, young, strong face, prominent nose,
      penetrating eyes. Even then it flattered him. The man now sitting at the
      enormous desk was twenty-nine years older. The big hooked nose was still
      there. The pale-green eyes were still a striking feature; but they looked
      tired now. There was the strip of whisker on each cheek, close-clipped,
      tinged now with gray. He was heavier in neck and shoulders. There were
      deep lines about the wide, thin, orator's mouth. Despite the nose and eyes
      there was something yielding about that mouth; something of the old
      politician who has learned to temper strength with craft, who has learned,
      too, that human nature moves and functions within rather narrow limits and
      is assailed by subtle weaknesses. It was an enigmatic face. Beneath it
      were low turnover collar, the usual white string tie and a well-worn black
      frock coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Wilde was nervous this morning. His eyes found it difficult to meet
      those of his mild-faced assistant in the old alpaca office coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hardwick&mdash;you may go, please!&rdquo; Thus Doctor Wilde; and he threw
      out his hands in a nervous gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, sensing some new tension in the office atmosphere, Hy
      caught himself thinking of Sue Wilde. She had a trick of throwing out her
      hands like that. Only she did it with extraordinary grace. In certain ways
      they were alike, this eccentric gifted man and his eccentric equally
      gifted daughter. Not in all particulars; for Sue had charm. &ldquo;Must get it
      from her mother's side,&rdquo; mused Hy. He knew that the mother was dead, that
      the house from which Sue had fled to Greenwich Village and Art and Freedom
      was now presided over by a second wife who dressed surprisingly well, and
      whose two children&mdash;little girls&mdash;were on occasions brought into
      the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reverie ended abruptly. Miss Hardwick had gathered up her note-books
      and pencils; was rising now; and as she passed out, released in Hy's
      direction one look that almost frightened him. It was a barbed shaft of
      bitter malevolence, oddly confused with trembling, incredible triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please!&rdquo; It was Doctor Wilde's voice. Hy sat down in the chair
      that was always kept for him across the huge desk from the doctor. That
      gentleman had himself risen, creaked over to the door, was closing it
      securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had that queer look meant? From Miss Hardwick of all people! To Hy
      she had been hardly more than an office fixture. But in that brief instant
      she had revealed depths of hatred, malignant jealousy&mdash;something!
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sank heavily into his own chair. Hy, mystified, watched him and
      waited. The man reached for a paper-weight&mdash;a brass model of his
      first mission house from Africa or Madagascar or somewhere&mdash;and
      placed it before him on top of the unopened morning's mail, moved it this
      way, then a little that way and looked at it critically. Hy, more and more
      startled, a thought hypnotized, leaned forward on the desk and gazed at
      that little brass house. Finally the doctor spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an unpleasant duty&mdash;but it is not a matter that I can lightly
      pass over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy paled a little, knit his brows, stared with increasing intensity at
      that mission house of brass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a long time, Mr. Lowe, I have felt that your conduct was not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Hy, in a daze, &ldquo;my conduct was not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;was not&mdash;well, in keeping with your position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my position.&rdquo; Hy's numb mind repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a matter of a particular act or a particular occasion, Mr.
      Lowe. For a long time it has been known to me that you sought undesirable
      companions, that you have been repeatedly seen in&mdash;in Broadway
      resorts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy's mind was stirring awake now, darting this way and that like a
      frightened mouse. Some one had been talking to the doctor&mdash;and very
      recently. The man was a coward in office matters; he had been goaded to
      this. The &ldquo;for a long time,&rdquo; so heavily repeated, was of course a verbal
      blind. Could it have been&mdash;not Miss Hardwick. Then Hy was surprised
      to hear his own voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a charge, Doctor Wilde! A charge should be definite.&rdquo; The
      words came mechanically. Hy must have read them somewhere. &ldquo;I surely have
      a right to know what has bcen said about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that it is necessary to be specific,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      apparently now that the issue was joined, finding his task easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must insist!&rdquo; cried Hy, on his feet now. He was thinking&mdash;&ldquo;What
      has she told him? What does she know? What does she know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; said Doctor Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy sat down. His chief moved the mission house a trifle to square it with
      the edge of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To mention only one occasion,&rdquo; went on the doctor's voice&mdash;&ldquo;though
      many are known to me, I am well informed regarding the sort of life you
      are known to be leading. You see, Mr. Lowe, you must understand that the
      office atmosphere of <i>My Brother's Keeper</i> is above reproach. Ability
      alone will not carry a man here. There are standards finer and truer than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rhetorical note was creeping into the man's voice. He turned
      instinctively to sec if Miss Hardwick was catching the precious words as
      they fell from his lips; then with his eyes on her empty chair he
      floundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone rang. Hy, with alacrity grown out of long practise in
      fending for his chief, reached for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Lowe&mdash;&rdquo; It was the voice of the pretty little telephone
      girl: &ldquo;It's a lady! She simply won't be put off! Could you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Hy with cold solemnity, &ldquo;that I am in an important
      Conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did tell her that, Mr. Lowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;ask him to leave his number. I can not be disturbed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hung up the receiver. &ldquo;Doctor Wilde,&rdquo; he said in the same Solemn tone.
      &ldquo;I realize of course that you are asking for my resignation. But first I
      must know the charge against me. There has been an attack on my character.
      I have the right to demand full knowledge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To mention only one occasion,&rdquo; said the doctor, as if unaware of the
      interruption, still fussing with the mission house, &ldquo;you were seen, as
      recently as last evening, leaving a questionable restaurant in company
      with a still more questionable young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was all he knew! Hy breathed a very little more easily. Then the
      telephone rang again, and Hy's overstrained nerves jumped like mad. &ldquo;Very
      well,&rdquo; said he to the pretty telephone girl, &ldquo;put him on my wire.&rdquo; And to
      his chief: &ldquo;You will have to excuse me, Doctor. This appears to be
      important.&rdquo; He rose with extreme dignity and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within his own office he stood clinging to the door-knob, breathing
      hard. It was all over! He was fired. He must begin life again&mdash;like
      General Grant. His own telephone bell was ringing frantically. At first he
      hardly heard it. Finally he pulled himself together and moved toward the
      desk. It would be Betty, of course. She ought to have more sense! Why
      hadn't she stayed up-state with that new husband of hers, anyway! Wasn't
      life disastrous enough without a very much entangled, contrite Betty on
      his own still more entangled hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice was not that of Betty. Nor was it the voice of Silvia. It
      was a soft little voice, melodious, hesitating. It was familiar, yet
      unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;is that you? I've had such a hard time getting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry!&rdquo; breathed Hy. Who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awfully busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy hesitated. Deep amid the heaped and smoking runs of his life a little
      warm thing was stirring. It was the very instinct for adventure. He looked
      grimly about the room, to be his office no longer. He didn't care
      particularly what happened now. His own voice even took on something of
      the strange girl's softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so awfully,&rdquo; said he. Then groping for words added: &ldquo;Where are you
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up at the Grand Central.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness! You're not going away&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;going home. I feel awfully bad about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence intervened. Then this from Hy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you're not alone up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a charmingly plaintive little voice it was, anyway! The healthy color
      was returning to Hy's cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;well, say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long&mdash;when does your train go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, could you? I didn't dare ask&mdash;you seemed so busy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could be there in&mdash;well, under fifteen minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good. I've got&mdash;let me see&mdash;nearly half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be by the clock in the main waiting-room Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy slammed down the receiver; tore off the alpaca coat and stuffed it into
      the waste basket; got into his street coat; observed the editorial shears
      on the desk; seized them, cut the buzzer wires, noted with satisfaction
      the nick he made in one blade; threw the shears to the floor and rushed
      from the office.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THE WILD FAGAN PERSON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the flower store
      in the station he bought a red carnation for his lapel and walked briskly
      toward the big clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slim girl was there at the inquiry desk, very attractively dressed. His
      pulse bounded. She turned a forlornly pretty face and he saw that it was
      Hilda Hansen of Wisconsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands met. They wandered off toward the dim corridor where the
      telephones are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was dear of you to come,&rdquo; said she rather shyly. &ldquo;I shall feel better
      now. I was beginning to think&mdash;well, that you didn't like me very
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hilda&mdash;that's not fair!&rdquo; he murmured. Murmured, IF the whole truth
      were told, rather blithely. For Hilda was pretty. Her soft dependence was
      the sweetest flattery. Her simple, easily satisfied mind was a relief
      after certain slightly more desperate adventures. And so, when he said,
      &ldquo;I'm sorry you're going, Hilda. Is it for long?&rdquo; he spoke as sincerely as
      is commonly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For good!&rdquo; she blurted out in reply to this; and the tears came. He took
      her arm and walked her farther down the corridor. The little story was
      tumbling out now, helter skelter. Her father had stopped her allowance,
      ordered her home. She was leaving forever the freedom of dear old
      Greenwich Village. Naturally Hy kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her again, right out on the train platform, with belated
      passengers elbowing by and porters looking on. It was Hy's little
      sacrament of freedom. He could kiss them now&mdash;in public&mdash;as he
      chose! For he was fired. No more gloomy old office! No more of the gliding
      Miss Hardwick! No more of the doctor's oratory! No more of that damn
      buzzer!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing to do, of course, was to go back and pack up his belongings; but
      he couldn't bring himself to it. So he stayed out until lunch time,
      filling in the odd hour with an eleven o'clock movie show. He lunched
      expensively and alone at the club, off a porterhouse steak with mushrooms,
      potatoes &ldquo;au gratin,&rdquo; creamed spinach, musty ale in pewter, romaine salad,
      Camembert cheese with toasted biscuit and black coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reentered his office, who should be sitting there but the Worm.
      Before he could overcome a slight embarrassment and begin the necessary
      process of telling his story, a heavy crushing step sounded in the
      corridor, passed the door, went on into the big room in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm rose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that the Walrus?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to see him. Will you take me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sit down! I can tell you more than he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, but at another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy emerged from his self-absorption at this point sufficiently to observe
      that the Worm, usually smiling and calm, was laboring under some
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come along!&rdquo; And quite light of heart, afraid of
      nothing now, he led the Worm in and introduced him as, &ldquo;My friend, Mr.
      Bates of <i>The 'Courier</i>.&rdquo; Then, hearing his telephone ringing again,
      he hurried back to his own office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be Betty, of course. Well, as far as the office was concerned, it
      didn't matter now. She could call! Anybody could call.... He picked up the
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he murmured&mdash;&ldquo;hello, Silvia! Wait a moment.&rdquo; He got up and
      closed the door. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;What is it, little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;thank God, I've found you! Hy, something dreadful has
      almost happened. It has done such things to my pride! But I knew you
      wouldn't want me to turn to any one else for help, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said he, with sudden queer misgivings, &ldquo;of course not! Not for a
      minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd feel that way, dear. Are you dreadfully busy? Could you&mdash;I
      know it's a lot to ask&mdash;but could you, for me, dear, run out for five
      minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; said he, with an emphasis aimed as much at himself as at her.
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talking from the drug store across the street, right near you. I'll
      wait outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The misgivings deepened as Hy walked slowly out to the elevator and then
      out to the street. Hy would have to be classified, in the last analysis,
      as a city bachelor, a seasoned, hardened city bachelor. The one prospect
      that instantly and utterly terrifies a hardened city bachelor is that of
      admitting that another has a moral claim upon him. The essence of
      bachelordom is the avoidance of personal responsibility. Therefore it was
      a reserved, rather dignified Hy who crossed the street and joined the
      supple, big-eyed, conspicuous young woman in the perfect-fitting tailor
      suit. Another factor in Hy's mood, perhaps, was that the memory of Hilda
      Hansen's soft young lips against his own had not yet wholly died.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Silvia walked slowly around the corner. &ldquo;I don't know how to tell
      you,&rdquo; she said in an unsteady voice. There were tears in her eyes, too.
      &ldquo;Hy, it's awful! It's my&mdash;my furniture!&rdquo; The tears fell now. She
      wiped them away. &ldquo;They say positively they'll take it away tonight. Every
      stick. I've cried so! I tried to explain that I'm actually rehearsing with
      Cunningham. Before the end of the month I can take care of it easily. But&mdash;&rdquo;
       Hy stopped short, stood on the curb, looked at her. His head was clear and
      cold as an adding machine. &ldquo;How much would it take?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hy.&rdquo; She was crying again. &ldquo;Don't talk in that way&mdash;so cold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he broke in, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's fifty dollars. You see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a perceptible ring in his voice. She looked at him, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silvia, dear&mdash;I'm fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fired? Hy&mdash;when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day. Chucked out. I haven't got half of that&mdash;to live on, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, you oughtn't to live in this careless way, not saving a
      cent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I oughtn't. But I do. That's me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what on earth&mdash;what reason&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conduct. I'm a bad one.&rdquo; He was almost triumphant. &ldquo;Only last night I was
      seen leaving a questionable restaurant&mdash;where they dance and drink&mdash;with
      a young lady&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were not falling now. Miss Silvia So-rana was looking straight
      at him, thoughtful, even cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you telling me the truth, Hy Lowe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gospel. I'm not even the proletariat. I'm the unemployed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;well!&rdquo; And she thought it deliberately out. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I
      guess you can't be blamed for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which impressed Hy later when he thought it over, as a curious remark.
      They parted shortly after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first she said, &ldquo;Hy, dear, I don't like to seem to be leaving you on
      account of this. It must be dreadfully hard for you.&rdquo; So they had a soda,
      sitting in the drug store window. Hy almost smiled, thinking of the
      madness of it&mdash;he and an unmistakable actress, in working hours, here
      actually in the shadow of grim old Scripture House! And it was nobody's
      business! It could hurt nobody! He had not known that freedom would be
      like this. There was a thrill about it; so deep a thrill that after he had
      put the sympathetic but plainly hurrying Silvia on an up-town car and had
      paid for her as she entered, he could not bring himself to return to the
      office. Even with the Worm up there, wondering what had become of him.
      Even with all his personal belongings waiting to be cleared from the desk
      and packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered over to Washington Square, his spirit reveling in the lazy
      June sunshine. He stopped and listened to the untiring hurdy gurdy; threw
      coins to the little Italian girls dancing on the pavement. He thought of
      stopping in at the Parisian, ordering a &ldquo;sirop&rdquo; and reading or trying to
      read, those delightfully naughty French weeklies. He knew definitely now
      that he was out for a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a difficulty. It is easier to have a good time when there is a
      girl about. Really it was rather inopportune that Hilda Hansen had flitted
      back to Wisconsin. She needed a guardian; still she had been an appealing
      young thing up there at the Grand Central. But she had gone! And Silvia&mdash;well,
      that little affair had taken an odd and not over-pleasant turn. The pagan
      person had, plainly, her sophisticated moments. He was glad that he had
      seen through her. For that matter, you couldn't ever trust her sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then creeping back into his mind like a pet dog after a beating, hesitant,
      all fears and doubts of a welcome, came the thought of Betty Deane.

      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;HE WHO HESITATED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HERE was Betty,
      anyway! And why hadn't she called up the office. It began to seem to him
      that she might have done that after her little effort of the morning.
      Hitherto, before that ridiculous marriage of hers, she had always put up
      with Sue Wilde, over in Tenth Street. Perhaps she was there now. Mental
      pictures began to form of Betty's luxuriant blonde beauty. And it was
      something for a peach like that to leave home and rich husband, come
      hurrying down to New York and call you up at an ungodly hour in the
      morning. He remembered suddenly, warmly, the time he had first kissed
      Betty&mdash;over in New Jersey, on a green hillside, of a glowing
      afternoon. His laziness fell away. Briskly he walked around into Tenth
      Street and rang Sue's bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty answered&mdash;prettier than ever, a rounded but swaying young
      creature who said little and that slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Sue's out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want Sue. Came to see you, Betty. I'm fired&mdash;out of a job&mdash;and
      while it lasts, hilariously happy. How about a bite at the Parisian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they had humorously early tea at the old French restaurant near the
      Square. Then Betty went up-town on the bus for a little shopping, and Hy
      walked, at last, back to the office. They had decided to meet again for
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripture House loomed before him&mdash;long, dingy, grim in the gay
      sunshine. He stood motionless on the farther curb, staring at it. Had
      three years of his life been spent, miserably spent, on a treadmill, in
      that haunt of hypocrisy? Had he been selling his presumably immortal soul
      on the instalment plan, at forty-five a week? Or was it a hideous dream?
      Was he dreaming now?
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered. Then, slowly, he walked across the street, deriding to pack
      up and get out for good just as swiftly as the thing could be done. He was
      glad, downright glad, that it was his character that had been so crudely
      assailed. That let him out. He needn't be decent&mdash;needn't wait a
      month to break in a new man&mdash;nothing like that! He wondered mildly
      what the Worm would say, and Peter? It might be necessary to borrow a bit
      until he could get going again. Though perhaps they would take him back on
      the old paper until he could find something regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of being haunted by a dream grew as he went up in the elevator
      and walked along the hall. He saw with new eyes the old building he had so
      long taken for granted&mdash;saw the worn hollows in the oak floors, the
      patched cracks in the plaster; he smelt the old musty odor with new'
      repugnance; noted the legends on office doors he passed with a wry smile,
      the Reverend This and the Reverend That, the Society for the Suppression
      of Such and Such, the commercially religious Somebody &amp; Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to will his hand to open the door lettered, &ldquo;My Brother's Keeper;
      Hubbell Harkness Wilde, D. D.&rdquo; He had to will his feet to carry him
      within. But once within, he stood motionless and the queerness seized on
      him, widened his eyes, caught at his breath. For the place was absolutely
      still. Not a typewriter sounded. Not an argumentative voice floated out
      over the seven-foot partitions. It was like a dead place&mdash;uncanny,
      awful. For an instant he considered running; wondered fantastically
      whether his feet would turn to lead and hold him back as feet do in
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he stood his ground and looked cautiously about. There within the
      rail, in the corner, the pretty little telephone girl sat motionless at
      her switchboard, watching him with eyes that stared stupidly out of a
      white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to her side&mdash;tiptoeing in spite of himself&mdash;tried to
      smile, cleared his throat, started at the sound; then whispered, &ldquo;For
      Heaven's sake, what's the matter?&rdquo; and patted the girl's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily she would have dodged away and looked anxiously about in fear
      of being seen. Now she did nothing of the sort. After a moment she said,
      also whispering and quite incoherently&mdash;&ldquo;Is Miss Hardwick going to
      have your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her voice and out of sheer nervousness, he gulped. She was
      alive, at least. He pinched her cheek; and shook his head, rather
      meaninglessly. Then he braced himself and went on in, wholly unaware that
      he was still tiptoeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two girl stenographers sat in a coiner, whispering. At sight of him they
      hushed. He passed on. The other girls were not at their desks, though he
      thought that most of their hats and coats hung in the farther corner as
      usual. The office boy was not to be seen. The copy editor and proof-reader
      was not in her cubby-hole at the end of the corridor. Miss Hardwick's door
      was shut; but as he passed he thought he heard a rustle within, and he was
      certain that he saw the tip of a hat feather over the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to his own door. It was ajar. He felt sure he had closed it when
      he left. It was his regular practise to close it. He stopped short,
      considering this as if it was a matter of genuine importance. Then it
      occurred to him that the boy might have been in there with proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Wilde's door at the end of the corridor stood open. The seven-foot
      square mahogany desk, heaped with papers and books, looked natural enough,
      but the chair behind it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tiptoed forward, threw his door open. Then he literally gasped. For
      there, between the desk and the window, stood the Walrus. He held the
      nicked editorial shears in his hand&mdash;he must have picked them up from
      the floor&mdash;and was in the act of looking from them to the cut ends of
      the wires by the buzzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy's overcharged nervous system leaped for the nearest outlet. &ldquo;I cut the
      damn things myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Walrus turned toward him an ashen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't know they were objectionable to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've hated them for three years,&rdquo; said Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have spoken. It is better to speak of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak nothing!&rdquo; Hy sputtered. &ldquo;I stood a fine chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; observed Doctor Wilde, as if he had not heard&mdash;his voice
      was husky and curiously weak&mdash;&ldquo;we were interrupted this morning. You
      were wrong in imagining that a resignation was necessary. You jumped at
      that conclusion. I should say that you were unnecessarily touchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my character&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, it seems to me that you were unnecessarily touchy. A man must
      not be too sensitive. He should be strong to take as well as give blows.
      Your actions, it seemed to me, perhaps wrongly, were a blow to me, to the
      prestige of this establishment. You must understand, Mr. Lowe, that in
      this life that we all must live&rdquo;&mdash;absently he looked about to see if
      Miss Hardwick's pencil was poised to render imperishable the thought that
      he was about to put into words, caught himself, brushed a limp hand (with
      the shears in them) across his eyes, then went on with an effort&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will say further that when we spoke this morning I had not seen the dummy
      for the issue of July tenth. Now I don't mind telling you that I regard
      that as a good dummy. You have there caught my ideas of sound make-up
      better than ever before. And I have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my character&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I have just written instructions to Mr. Hennessy to make a
      change in your salary beginning with next Saturday's envelope. You are now
      doing the work of a full managing editor. Your income should be sufficient
      to enable you to support the position with reasonable dignity. Hereafter
      you will draw sixty dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved toward the door. He seemed suddenly a really old man, grayer of
      hair and skin, more bent, less certain of his footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Hy, sputtering in uncontrollable excitement, &ldquo;those are my
      shears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so they are. I did not notice.&rdquo; And the Walrus came back, laid them
      carefully on the desk: then walked out, entered his own room, closed the
      dour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy shut his door, stood for a moment by the desk, sank, an inert figure,
      into his chair. His eyes focused on the old alpaca coat, stuffed into the
      waste basket. He took it out; spread it on the desk and stared at the ink
      stains. &ldquo;I can have it cleaned,&rdquo; he thought. Suddenly he pressed two
      shaking hands to his throbbing head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he muttered, aloud. &ldquo;What did I say to him. What didn't I say to
      him? I'm a loon! I'm a nut! This is the asylum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stiffened up; sat there for a moment, wildeyed. He reached down and
      pinched his thigh, hard. He sprang up and paced the room. He wheeled
      suddenly, craftily, on the silent buzzer, there on the partition. So far
      all right&mdash;the wires were cut!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the shears lying on the desk; pounced on them and feverishly
      examined the blades. One was nicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, so good. But the supreme test remained. He plunged out into the
      silent corridor, hesitated, stood wrestling with the devils within him,
      conquered them and white as all the ghosts tapped at Doctor Wilde's door,
      opened it a crack, stuck in his head, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you say it was to be, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Walrus compressed his lips, and then drew a deep breath that was not
      unlike a sigh. &ldquo;The figure I mentioned,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;was sixty dollars a
      week. If that is satisfactory to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy considered this. &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;considering
      everything, I will agree to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes past midnight Hy let himself into the rooms. One gas jet
      was burning dimly in the studio. As he stood on the threshold he could
      just make out the long figure of the Worm half reclining in the Morris
      chair by a wide-open window, attired in the striped pajamas of the
      morning. From one elevated foot dangled a slipper of Chinese straw. He was
      smoking his old brier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Hy cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence. Then, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; replied the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy tossed his hat on the couch-bed of the absent Peter, then came and
      stood by the open window, thrust hands deep into trousers packets, sniffed
      the mild evening air, gazed benevolently on the trees, lights and little
      moving figures of the Square. Then he lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great night, my son!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm lowered his pipe, looked up with sudden sharp interest, studied
      the gay young person standing so buoyantly there before him; then replaced
      the pipe and smoked on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried Hy, after a bit. &ldquo;Buck up! Be a live young newspaper
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a newspaper man,'&rdquo; replied the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not a&mdash;-you were this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, my son, what were you around for today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pipe came down again. &ldquo;You mean to say you don't know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. Except that the place went absolutely on the fritz. I
      thought I had 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder,&rdquo; muttered Henry Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Walrus raised me fifteen bucks per. Just like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He raised you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child.&rdquo; Hy came around, sat on the desk, dangled his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; observed the Worm, &ldquo;he certainly thinks you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elucidate! Elucidate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm knocked the ashes from his pipe; turned the warm bowl around and
      around in his hand. &ldquo;Our paper&mdash;I should say <i>The Courier</i>&mdash;.
      has a story on Doctor Wilde&mdash;a charge that he has misappropriated
      missionary funds. They sent me up to-day to ask if he would consent to an
      accounting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The amount is put roughly at a million dollars. I didn't care much about
      the assignment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm fond of Sue. But it was my job. When I told him what I was there for,
      he ran me out of his office, locked the door and shouted through the
      transom that he had a bottle of poison in his desk and would take it if I
      wouldn't agree to suppress the story. As if he'd planned exactly that
      scene for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; cried Hy&mdash;&ldquo;melodrama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Melodrama. It was unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accepted the gentleman's proposition, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dislike murders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy, considering this, stiffened up. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what's the paper
      going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the assistant city editor this evening at the Parisian bar. He
      tells me they have decided to drop the story. But they dropped me first.&rdquo;
       He looked shrewdly at Hy. &ldquo;So don't worry. You can count on your raise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy's cigarette had gone out. He looked at it, tossed it out the window,
      lit a fresh one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a fellow likes to know where he gets off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at least that he is off,&rdquo; said the Worm, and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy let him go. A dreamy expression came into his eyes. As he threw off
      coat and waistcoat and started unbuttoning his collar, he hummed softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I want si-<i>imp</i>-athee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Si-<i>imp</i>-athee, just <i>symp</i>-ah-thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He embraced an imaginary young woman&mdash;a blonde who was slow of speech
      and luxurious in movements&mdash;and danced slowly, rather gracefully
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was right with the world!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;ENTER MARIA TONIFETTI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HOUGH there is no
      known specific for heartache, there are palliatives. One such Peter
      Ericson Mann found in the head barber's chair at the strictly sanitary
      shop of Manus. The necessity, during all the spring months, of avoiding
      this shop had irked Peter; for he was given to worry in the matter of
      bacteria. And he could not himself shave his thin and tender skin without
      irritating it to the point of eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop of Marius was in the basement of that most interesting of New
      York restaurants, the Parisian. The place is wholly French, from the large
      trees out front and in their shade the sleepy victorias always waiting at
      the curb to the Looeys and Sharlses and Gastongs that serve you within. It
      is there a distinction to be known of the maître d'hôtel, an achievement
      to nod to the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenwich Village, when in funds, dines, lunches, breakfasts at the
      Parisian. Upper West Side, when seeking the quaintly foreign dissociated
      from squalor, dines there. Upper West Side always goes up the wide front
      steps and through the busy little office into the airy eating rooms with
      full length hinged windows. There is music here; a switchboard youth who
      giftedly blends slang with argot; even, it has been reported, an interior
      fountain. Greenwich Village now and again ascends those wide front steps;
      but more often frequents the basement where is neither fountain nor music,
      merely chairs, tables and ineffable food; these latter in three or four
      small rooms which you may enter from the Avenue, directly under the steps,
      or from the side street through the bar. The corner room, nearest the bar,
      is a haunt of such newspaper men as live in the neighborhood. Also in the
      basement is a rather obscure and crooked passage extending from the bar
      past the small rooms and the barber shop of Marius to the equally obscure
      and crooked stairway that leads by way of telephone booths and a passage
      to the little office hallway and the upper restaurant. The whole,
      apparently, was arranged with the mechanics of French farce uppermost in
      the mind of the architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's large horn-rimmed eye-glasses hung by their heavy black ribbon
      from the frame of the mirror; his long person lay, relaxed, in the chair.
      His right foot rested on a bent-wire stand; and kneeling respectfully
      before it, polishing the shoe, was the boy called Theophile. His left hand
      lay on the soft palm of Miss Maria Tonifetti who was working soothingly,
      head bowed, on the thumb nail. Miss Tonifetti was pretty. She happens to
      be the reason why Peter had kept away from the shop of Marius all spring.
      These Italian girls, from below Washington Square, were known to be of an
      impetuous temper. Hy Lowe had on several occasions advised Peter to let
      them alone. Hy believed that they, carried knives. Now, however, finding
      Maria so subdued, if gloomily emotional, of eye, experiencing again the
      old soft thrill as her deft smooth fingers touched and pressed his own, he
      was seriously considering asking her out to dinner. He had first thought
      of this while Marius (himself) was plying the razor. (What a hand had
      Marius!) The notion grew during the drowsily comfortable shampoo that came
      next. With the face massage, and the steaming towels that followed it&mdash;one
      of these now covered his face, with a minute breathing hole above the nose&mdash;came
      a gentle glow of tenderness toward all the world and particularly toward
      Miss Tonifetti. After all, he had never intended neglecting her. Life is
      so complex!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hoped to slip through this narrative with no more than an occasional
      and casual allusion to Maria. But this, it appears, is not possible. She
      matters. And even at the risk of a descent into unromantic actuality, into
      what you might call &ldquo;realism,&rdquo; she enters at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter himself, like most of us, disliked actuality. His plays were all of
      duty and self-sacrifice and brooding tenderness and that curious structure
      that is known throughout the theatrical district as Honor. Honor with a
      very large H&mdash;accompanied, usually, with a declamatory gesture and a
      protruding chest. Sue, at her first meeting with Peter, when she talked
      out so impulsively, really said the last word about his plays. Peter's
      thoughts of himself (and these never flagged) often took the form of
      recollecting occasions when he had been kind to newsboys or when he had
      lent a helping hand to needy young women without exacting a quid pro quo.
      The occasions when he had not been kind took the memory-shape of proper
      indignation aroused by bitter injustice to himself. He had suffered
      greatly from injustice as from misunderstanding. Few, indeed, understood
      him; which fact added incalculably to the difficulties of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now just a word of recent history and we shall get on with our story. When
      Sue broke her engagement to Peter he took his broken heart away to
      Atlantic City, where he had before now found diversion and the impulse to
      work. He had suffered deeply, these nearly two weeks. His food had not set
      well. The thought of solitary outdoor exercise, even ocean swimming, had
      been repellent. And until the last two or three nights, his sleeplessness
      had been so marked as really to worry him. Night after night he had caught
      himself sitting straight up in bed saying, aloud, harsh things to the
      penitent weeping Sue of his dreams. Usually after these experiences his
      thoughts and nerves had proved to be in such a tangle that his only
      recourse had been to switch on the lights and, with a trembling hand and
      an ache at the back of his head, plunge into his work. The work, therefore
      (it was a new play), had gone rather well&mdash;so well that when the
      expensiveness of the life began to appear really alarming he was ready to
      come back to the old haunts and make the effort to hold up his head. He
      had got into New York at four-ten and come down to the shop of Marius by
      taxi. His suit-case and grip were over in the corner by the coat rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now nearly five-thirty. The face massage was over with; his thick
      dark hair had been brushed into place by the one barber in New York who
      did not ask &ldquo;Wet or dry?&rdquo; And he was comfortably seated, across the shop,
      at Miss Tonifetti's little wire-legged table, for the finishing strokes of
      the buffer and the final soap-and-water rinsing in the glass bowl. He
      looked at the bent head and slightly drooping shoulders of the girl. The
      head was nicely poised. The hair was abundant and exceptionally fine. It
      massed well. As at certain other moments in the dim past his nature
      reacted pleasantly to some esthetically pleasing quality in hair, head,
      shoulders and curve of dark cheek. Just then she glanced up, flushed
      perceptibly, then dropped her eyes and went on with her work&mdash;which
      consisted at the moment in giving a final polish by-brushing the nails
      lightly with the palm of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glow in Peter's heart leaped up into something near real warmth. He
      leaned forward, glanced swiftly about, then said, low: &ldquo;It has been hard,
      Maria&mdash;not seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark head bent lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did seem best. You know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head nodded a very little&mdash;doubtfully. &ldquo;There's no sense in being
      too hard on ourselves, Maria. Suppose&mdash;oh, come on and have dinner
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the head was inclined in assent. And he heard her whisper, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter thought swiftly. This was not a matter for his acquaintances of the
      Square and Greenwich Village. Then, too, a gentleman always &ldquo;protected the
      girl.&rdquo; Suddenly he remembered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me at the old place&mdash;corner of Tenth. We can take the bus
      up-town. You can't get off early?&rdquo; She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Say twenty after to half-past seven. I'll leave my bags here
      for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, after all, was living! It was best. You had to keep on. And it would
      be nice to give Maria a good time. She had been exacting in the past,
      given to unexpected outbursts, a girl of secretive ways, but of violent
      impulses, that she seemed always struggling to suppress. He had noted
      before now a passionate sort of gloom in the girl. To-day, though, she was
      charming, gentle enough for anybody. Yes, for old times' sake&mdash;in
      memory of certain intense little episodes they two had shared, he would
      give her a nice evening.... With such thoughts he complacently lighted a
      cigarette, smiled covertly at the girl, who was following him furtively,
      with her big dark eyes and went back through the crooked corridor to the
      bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we find Hy Lowe engaged in buying a drink for Sumner Smith, one of
      the best-known reporters on that most audaciously unscrupulously brilliant
      of newspapers, <i>The Evening Earth</i>. Sumner Smith was fat,
      sleepy-eyed, close-mouthed. He was a man for whom Peter felt profound if
      cautious respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his thoughts were not now concerned with the locally famous reporter,
      were not concerned, for the moment, even with himself. He was impressed by
      the spectacle of Hy Lowe standing treat, casually tossing out a
      five-dollar bank note; so much so that he promptly and with a grin
      accepted Hy's nod as an invitation and settled, after a moment's
      thoughtful consideration, on an old-fashioned whisky cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that Hy was stingy; simply that the task of dressing well,
      taking in all the new shows and entertaining an apparently inexhaustible
      army of extraordinarily pretty girls with taxis and even occasional wine
      was at times too much for the forty-five a week that Hy earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as it happened, while Peter thought about Hy, Hy was thinking about
      Peter. Not six times in the more than three years of his life with Peter
      and the Worm had Hy seen so jovial an expression on the long face of the
      well-known playwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was self-conscious to the point of morbidity. This at all times,
      dating far, far back of his painful relationship with Sue Wilde, back of
      his tempestuous affair with Grace Derring, back of the curious little
      mix-up with that Tonifetti girl. Lately he had been growing worse. Why, it
      was not yet a fortnight since he had fought Zanin, over at the Muscovy.
      Then Sue had broken their engagement, and Peter had left town a crushed
      and desperate man. Hy had gone to the trouble of worrying about him; an
      exertion which he was now inclined to resent a bit. He had even mentioned
      his fears to the Worm; which sage young man had smiled and observed dryly
      and enigmatically, &ldquo;Peter will never really love anybody else.&rdquo;... And
      now, of all times, Peter was grinning!
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist left them to read <i>Le Sourire</i> and nibble toast in the
      corner room. Peter cheerfully regarded Hy's new homespun suit, his real
      Panama hat with a colored stripe in the white fluffy band, his flaming new
      tie and the silk shirt of exclusive pattern beneath it. Hy caught this
      scrutiny, and returned the grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in soft, Pete,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Got a raise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not out of old Wilde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy nodded. &ldquo;Considerable story, my son. First the old boy fired me. That
      was at nine-thirty A. m. I went out and made a day of it. Then, of all
      things, the Worm comes into the office&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Worm! Henry Bates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. He was on <i>The Courier</i>, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was&mdash;and isn't. They sent him up with a stiff story about the
      missionary funds we've collected through the paper. And what does the old
      boy do but lock him out and holler through the transom that he'll eat
      poison, just like that, unless the Worm goes back and kills the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does the Worm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As per instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kills the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his job with it. He's writing a novel now&mdash;like everybody else.
      Have another,&rdquo; Hy added cheerfully, &ldquo;on the old Walrus' partner in crime.&rdquo;
       Peter had another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of it is&rdquo;&mdash;this from Hy&mdash;&ldquo;I come in at four-thirty
      that afternoon to pack up my things, and the Reverend Doctor Wilde hands
      me a raise. I get sixty now. I am on that famous road to wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy chuckled. &ldquo;Worm says the old boy thought I knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; breathed Peter. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say I wonder at Sue's leaving home, hitting out for the
      self-expression thing.&rdquo; Hy grew more expansive as the liquor spread its
      glowing warmth within his person. Otherwise he would hardly have spoken of
      Sue, even on the strength of that genial grin of Peter's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned an elbow on the mahogany bar and slowly sipped. &ldquo;I wonder if
      Sue suspects this.&rdquo; It was not easy for him to speak her name. But he did
      speak it, with an apparent casualness worthy of Waters Coryell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. I've worked at his elbow for years and never dreamed.&rdquo; He
      sighed. &ldquo;It's hard to see where a girl of any spirit gets off these days.
      From my experience with 'em, I'm convinced that home is the safest place
      for 'em, and yet it's only the dead ones that'll give up and stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not reply. His brows were knit, but not, apparently, in
      concentration, for his eyes wandered. He said something about getting his
      bags over to the rooms; started irresolutely down the passage toward the
      barber shop; stopped; pressed his fingers to his mouth; came back, passing
      Hy as if he didn't see him and went on out to the side street. Here he
      stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side street was narrow. A cross-town car shut off most of his view of
      the Avenue, a few yards away. Then it passed, and he saw a young couple
      strolling across toward the restaurant. The man&mdash;large, heavy of hand
      and foot, a peasant-like, face curiously lighted by burning eyes, better
      dressed than usual&mdash;was Jacob Zanin. The girl&mdash;slim,
      astonishingly fresh and pretty, not wearing the old tarn o' shanter and
      haphazard costume he associated with her, but a simple light suit&mdash;was
      Sue Wilde; the girl who by her hardness and selfishness had hurt Peter
      irreparably. There they were, chatting casually, quite at ease&mdash;Zanin,
      who didn't believe in marriage, who had pursued Sue with amazing patience
      for nearly two years, who had wrecked Peter's pocket; Sue, who had broken
      his heart.

      CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;PETER IS DRIVEN TO ACT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE spectacle
      stopped Peter's brain. Among all the wild pictures that had rushed helter
      skelter through his overwrought mind of late there had been nothing like
      this. Why, it was only a matter of days since he and Zanin had pummeled
      each other to an accompaniment of broken chairs, overturned tables,
      wrecked china, torn clothing, actual blood. He had pictured Sue, a
      confused disillusioned girl, rushing back to her home; Zanin a marked man,
      even in the Village, cowering away from his fellows. But this!
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the corner. With a great gulp of sheer emotion Peter followed,
      almost running. They turned into the Parisian&mdash;-but not into the
      familiar basement. Instead they mounted the wide front steps, as
      matter-of-fact as any two Upper West Siders out of a limousine. Peter
      pressed his hands to his eyes. He looked again. They had vanished within
      the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter walked back and forth. He told himself that he must think. But the
      fact clear even to his overwhelmed consciousness was that he was not
      thinking and that there was no immediate prospect of his being able to
      think. He went a whole block up the side street, stemming the thick tide
      of Jewish working girls from University Place and the lower Broadway
      district and men in overalls&mdash;muttering aloud, catching himself,
      compressing his lips, then muttering again. &ldquo;She played with me!&rdquo; So ran
      the muttering. &ldquo;She is utterly lacking in responsibility, in any sense of
      obligation. She lacks spirituality. That is it, she lacks spirituality.
      She has no fineness. She is hard&mdash;hard! She is drifting like a leaf
      on these crazy Village currents of irrepressible self-indulgence. I tried
      to save her&mdash;God knows I tried! I did my best! I can't be blamed if
      she goes to pieces now! I can do no more&mdash;I must let her go!&rdquo; But
      even while he spoke he gulped again; his face, nearly gray now, twisting
      painfully. He suddenly turned and rushed back to the Parisian.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused at the side doorway and peered in. Hy was not in evidence. A
      later glance, from within the barroom, disclosed that slightly illuminated
      young man in the corner room of the restaurant hanging over the table at
      which the taciturn Sumner Smith was still trying to read <i>Le Sourire</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter went on into the crooked passage, passed the open doors of two
      eating rooms where only the first early diners had as yet drifted in,
      found himself at the door of the barber shop, stopped short, then seeing
      the familiar figure of Maria Tonifetti approaching her table in the
      corner, dodged back and into the washroom. Here the boy named Anatole
      said, &ldquo;Good evening, Meester Mann,&rdquo; and filled a basin for him. Peter
      dipped his hands into the warm water and washed them. He was surprised to
      find his forehead dripping with sweat. He dried his hands, removed his
      glasses and scrubbed his face. He turned on the cold water, wet a towel
      and pressed it to his temples and the back of his head, taking care not to
      wet his collar. His hands were trembling. And that impulse to talk aloud
      was rising uncontrollably. He went back to the corridor; stood motionless,
      breathing deeply; recalled with the force of an inspiration that Napoleon
      had feared nothing, not even the ladies with whose lives his own had
      become so painfully entangled and walked deliberately, staring straight
      before him, past that barber shop door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the crooked stairway he paused again. And again his face
      was twisting. &ldquo;I've got to make the one more effort,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It isn't
      for myself, God knows! I gave her my love&mdash;I pledged her my life&mdash;I
      have suffered for her&mdash;I would have saved her if she had played fair!
      I've got to make this last effort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mounted the stairs, crowded past the telephone booths, staging at them
      as he went. They conveyed a suggestion to his mind. He stepped cautiously
      to the restaurant door, nodded to the maître d'hôtel and glanced in. The
      nearer room was empty; but beyond the second doorway, Zanin's shoulder and
      profile were visible. Sue he could not see, but she must be sitting there.
      Yes, Zanin was leaning forward, was speaking, even smiling, in that
      offhand way of his!
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, flushing now, turned away; confronted the boy called Raoul; pressed
      a silver quarter into his palm. &ldquo;Page, Miss Wilde,&rdquo; he breathed huskily.
      &ldquo;Tell her she is wanted on the phone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy named Raoul obeyed. At the Parisian it is not regarded as
      surprising that a gentleman should wish to speak to a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter rushed around the turn and Waited at the farther end of the row of
      booths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he heard her step.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw him she stopped. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; And she frowned a
      very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a deception,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;but I had to see you, Sue! I know you
      are with Zanin. I saw you come in. I don't see how you can do it, but
      we'll let that pass. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Peter? What do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sue! Are you as hard as that? What do I want of you! Good God! When I
      see you, after all I have suffered for your sake, plunging back into this
      life&mdash;taking up with that crock Zanin as if nothing had happened, as
      if&mdash;Why, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue grew a little white about the mouth and temples. She glanced back at
      the empty passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, curiously quiet, &ldquo;if you think it fair to follow me
      into a public place, if you really mean to make another hideous scene, you
      will have to come into the dining-room to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached out, caught her arm. She wrenched away and left him there. For
      a long moment he stared out the window at the rush of early evening
      traffic on the Avenue, his hands clenched at his sides. Then he hurried
      past the office and down to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the curb and addressed a rattling autobus. &ldquo;It is unbearable&mdash;unbelievable.
      The girl has lost all sense of the fitness of things. She is beside
      herself. I must act&mdash;act! I must act at once&mdash;to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People were passing. He turned, suddenly aware of the bustlingly
      unsympathetic, world about him. Had any one heard his voice? Apparently
      none had. All were hurrying on, up-town, down-town. Standing there on the
      curb he could see in at the basement window. Sumner Smith was alone at
      last and deep in <i>Le Sourire</i>. Hy had drifted away&mdash;back to the
      bar, doubtless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, you recall, was a genius. As a genius he fed on his emotional
      reactions; they were his life. Therefore do not judge him too harshly for
      the wild thought that at this point rushed over his consciousness with a
      force that left him breathless. He was frightened and by himself. But
      there was a barbarous exaltation in his fear. &ldquo;It'll bring her to her
      senses,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I've got to do it. Then she'll listen to me. She'll
      <i>have</i> to listen to me then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter appeared in the corner room down-stairs, almost as curiously quiet
      as Sue had been in their brief talk. He, too, was rather pale. He came
      over to Sumner Smith's table, dropped down opposite the fat journalist,
      beckoned a waiter, ordered a light dinner, and, that done, proffered a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a tip for you, Smith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a real one. If <i>The Evening
      Earth</i> hasn't lost its vigor you can put it over big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat man merely lighted his cigarette and looked inscrutably over it at
      Peter's drawn face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't give you the details. You'll have to take my word for them. Did
      you ever hear a question raised regarding the Reverend Doctor Wilde?&rdquo;
       Sumner Smith glanced out toward the bar and Hy. The corners of his mouth
      twitched. &ldquo;His boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. Editor of <i>My Brother's Keeper</i>. Author of the famous
      missionary sermons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a little talk last year. You mean the big mission funds he has
      raised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. His eyes were overbright now. &ldquo;Nobody has the evidence,
      Mann. It isn't news as it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you could <i>make</i> it news&mdash;big news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course&mdash;&rdquo; the journalist gestured with his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can. To-night. Go straight to his house&mdash;over in
      Stuyvesant Square, not five minutes in a taxi, not ten on the cars&mdash;and
      ask him point-blank to consent to an accounting. Just ask him.&rdquo; Sumner
      Smith mused. &ldquo;It might be worth trying,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my word for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The journalist paid his check, rose, nodded to an acquaintance across the
      room, said: &ldquo;I'll think it over, Mann. Much obliged&mdash;&rdquo; and sauntered
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unsatisfactory. Peter, crestfallen, forgot that Sumner Smith was
      hardened to sensations. And peering gloomily after the great reporter, he
      only half saw the man pause at the small desk near the bar, then speak
      casually to the now somewhat wobbly Hy Lowe: he only half heard a taxi
      pull up outside, a door slamming, the sudden grinding of gears as the taxi
      darted away. There were so many noises outside: you hardly noticed one
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought his dinner. He bolted it with unsteady hands. &ldquo;I must
      think this all out,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;If Sumner Smith won't do it, one of
      the other <i>Earth</i> men will. Or some one on <i>The Morning
      Continental.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a cigar, sat bark and gazed out at the dim street where dimmer
      figures and vehicles moved forever by. It occurred to him that thus would
      a man sit and smoke and meditate who was moved by an overmastering love to
      enact a tremendous deed. But it was difficult to sustain the pose with his
      temples throbbing madly and a lump in his throat. His heart, too, was
      skipping beats, he thought. Surreptitiously he felt his left wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beckoned the waiter; ordered paper and ink. The lump in his throat was
      suddenly almost a pain. He wrote&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was wrong of me, of course, Sue, dear. But I really must see you. Even
      though your hostile attitude makes it difficult to be myself. There is
      trouble impending. It concerns you vitally. If you will only hear me; meet
      me for half an hour after dinner, I know I can help you more than you
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking for myself but for you. In all this dreadful trouble
      between us, there is little I can ask of you. Only this&mdash;give me half
      an hour. I will wait down-stairs for an answer. P. E. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent this up-stairs. Then followed it as far as the telephones, called
      up his old acquaintance, Markham, of <i>The Morning Continental</i>, and
      whispered darkly to him over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ran down-stairs and dodged past the barber shop door, he became
      conscious that the dinner he had eaten felt now like a compact, insoluble
      ball in the region of his solar plexus. So he stopped at the bar and
      gulped a bicarbonate of soda while buying a highball for Hy Lowe whom he
      found confidentially informing the barkeeper of his raise from forty-five
      a week to sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he resumed his seat by the window in the corner room; tried to find
      amusement in the pages of <i>Le Sourire</i>; failed; watched the door with
      wild eyes, starting up whenever a waiter entered the room, only to sink
      back limply at each fresh disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered suddenly about Sumner Smith. What if he had followed the
      trail! This thought brought something like a chill. If he, Peter, an old
      newspaper man, were to be caught in the act of passing on an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo;
       tip to friends on competing papers&mdash;violating the sacred basis of
      newspaper ethics! You couldn't tell about Smith. He rarely showed
      interest, never emotion, seldom even smiled. He would receive the news
      that Emperor William had declared himself King of All the Americas with
      that same impassive front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at his watch. It was twenty-five minutes of seven. He had
      thought it at least eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was certain&mdash;he must get his bags out of that awful barber
      shop before it closed. Accordingly he had a messenger called to take them,
      over to the rooms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;SUE DOES NOT SEND FOR PETER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE familiar person
      of the Worm came in through the bar, stood in the doorway, looked about
      with quiet keen eyes&mdash;tall, carelessly dressed, sandy of hair but
      mild and reflective of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm's eyes rested on Peter. He came across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Peter, smiling, his mouth a curving crack in a ghastly
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Worm, &ldquo;you've heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm studied him a moment; then said, not without a touch of grave
      sympathy, &ldquo;Tell me, Pete&mdash;do you happen to know where Sue is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter heard this; tried to steady himself and speak in the properly casual
      tone. He swallowed. Then the words rushed out&mdash;low, trembling, all
      bitterness: &ldquo;She's up-stairs&mdash;with Zanin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm turned away. Peter caught his arm. &ldquo;For God's sake!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;What is it? What do you want of her? If anybody's got to tell her
      anything, it'll be me!&rdquo; And he pushed back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm laid a strong hand on his shoulder, held him firmly down in the
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; he said&mdash;quiet, deliberate&mdash;&ldquo;if you try to go up those
      stairs I myself will throw you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter struggled a little. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;good God! Who do you think
      you are! You mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short, stared up at the Worm,
      swallowed again. Then, &ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I get you! Like the damn
      fool I am, I never dreamed. So you're after her, too. You, with your
      books, your fine disinterestedness, your easy friendly ways&mdash;you're
      out for yourself, behind that bluff, just like the rest of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm glanced about the room. Neither had raised his voice. No one was
      giving them any particular attention. He relaxed his grip of Peter's arm;
      dropped into the chair opposite; leaned over the table on folded arms;
      fixed his rather compelling eyes on Peter's ashen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; he said, very quiet, very steady, &ldquo;listen to me carefully. And
      don't spill any paranoia tonight. If you do&mdash;if you start anything
      like that crazy fight at the Muscovy&mdash;I'll take a hand myself. Now
      sit quiet and try to hear what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was still swallowing. The Worm went steadily on. &ldquo;A neighbor of the
      Wilde's just now called up the apartment. They thought they might get Hy
      Lowe to find Sue and fetch her home. But Hy-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's&mdash;&rdquo; began Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him. He's outside here. He wants to sit on the curbstone and
      read the evening paper. A couple of chauffeurs were reasoning with him
      when I came in. I'm going to find her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's happened! You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father has taken poison. They think he is dying. His wife went right
      to pieces. Everything a mess&mdash;and two young children. They hadn't
      even got the doctor in when this man telephoned. He thinks the old boy is
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;that's absurd! It couldn't act so quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm stared; his face set perceptibly. &ldquo;It has acted. He didn't take
      the bichloride route. He drank carbolic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&mdash;that's awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's awful. There's a newspaper man there, raising hell. They can't
      get him out&mdash;or couldn't. Now keep this straight&mdash;if you go one
      step up those stairs or if you try to come out and speak to Sue before I
      get her away, I'll break your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll send for me,&rdquo; said Peter, sputtering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; observed Henry Bates; and swiftly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue Wilde returned from her brief interview with Peter. Two or three
      groups of early diners greeted her as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Zanin watched her&mdash;her brisk little nod and quiet smile for
      these acquaintances, her curiously boylike grace, the fresh tint of her
      olive skin. She was a bit thin, he thought; her hard work as principal
      actress in the Nature Film, coupled with the confusion he knew she had
      passed through during that brief wild engagement to Peter Mann, had worn
      her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had always puzzled him. She puzzled him now, as she resumed her seat,
      met his gaze, said: &ldquo;Jacob, give me a cigarette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue&mdash;you're off them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the film job was on. Breaking training now, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he mused aloud, &ldquo;I made you stop for good reason enough. But now
      I'm not sure that you're not wise.&rdquo; And he tossed his box across the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she lighted the cigarette, he studied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      None knew better than he the interesting variety of girls who came to the
      Village to seek freedom&mdash;some on intense feministic principles (Sue
      among these), others in search of the nearly mythical country called
      Buhemia, still others in the knowledge that there they might walk
      unquestioned without the cap of good repute. There were cliques and
      cliques in the Village; but all were in agreement regarding a freedom for
      woman equal to the experimental freedom of man. Love was admitted as a
      need. The human race was frankly a welter of animals struggling upward in
      the long process of evolution&mdash;struggling wonderfully. Conventional
      morality was hypocrisy and therefore a vice. Frankness regarding all
      things, an open mind toward any astonishing new theory in the psychology
      of the human creature, the divine right of the ego to realize itself at
      all costs, a fine scorn for all proverbial wisdom, something near a horror
      of the home, the church, and the practical business world&mdash;a blend of
      these was the Village, to be summed up, perhaps, in Waters Coryell's
      languid remark: &ldquo;I find it impossible to talk with any one who was born
      before 1880.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin had known many women. In his own way he had loved not a few. With
      these he had been hard, but not dishonest. He was a materialist, an
      anarchist, a self-exploiter, ambitious and unrestrained, torn within by
      the overmastering restlessness that was at once the great gift and the
      curse of his blood. He wanted always something else, something more. He
      was strong, fertile of mind, able. He had vision and could suffer. The
      companionship of a woman&mdash;here and there, now and then&mdash;meant
      much to him; but he demanded of her that she give as he would give,
      without sacrifice of work or self, without obligation. Nothing but what
      the Village terms &ldquo;the free relation&rdquo; was possible for Zanin. Within his
      peculiar emotional range he had never wanted a woman as he had wanted Sue.
      He had never given himself to another woman, in energy and companionship,
      as he had given himself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had eluded him. She had also eluded Peter. Zanin was capable of
      despising young women who talked freedom but were afraid to live it. There
      were such; right here in the Village there were such. But he did not think
      Sue's case so simple as that. He spoke out now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been thinking you over, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She deposited the ash of her cigarette on a plate, glanced gravely up at
      him, then lowered her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any result, Jacob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't found yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I haven't. Have you found me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly shook his head. &ldquo;I think you're doomed to grope for a while
      longer. I believe you have a good deal to find&mdash;more than some. You
      remember a while back when I urged you to take a trip with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not lift her eyes at this; merely gazed thoughtfully down at her
      cigarette. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I could help you. I thought you needed love. It seemed to be
      the next thing for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she rather shortly&mdash;&ldquo;you told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was wrong. Or my methods were. Something, I or some force,
      stirred you and to a bad result. You turned from me toward marriage. That
      plan was worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed about to protest; looked up now, threw out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he pressed on, &ldquo;as a plan, it didn't carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fine brows drew together perceptibly. &ldquo;That's over, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He settled back in his chair and looked about the lung room.
      It was filling rapidly. There were long hair and flowing ties, evening
      suits, smart gowns, bright lights, gay talk in two tongues, and just now,
      music. &ldquo;Tell me this much, Sue. What are you up to? There's no more
      Crossroads, no more Nature Film&mdash;lord, but that was a job! No more of
      that absurd engagement. This is why I dragged you out to-night. I'm
      wondering about you. What are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm drifting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you were trying to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying&mdash;yes! A girl has to appear to be doing something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No plans at all, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met this with silent assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked about the sprightly room; deliberately thinking. Once she
      glanced up at him; then waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I see you a little more clearly. If I'm wrong,
      correct me. You have an unusual amount of strength&mdash;or something. I
      don't know what it is. I'll fall back on the safe old word, personality.
      You've got plenty of intelligence. And your stage work, your dancing&mdash;you're
      gifted as all get-out. But you're like clockwork, you're no good unless
      your mainspring is working. You have to be wound up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in this talk Sue's green-brown eyes lighted. She leaned
      over the table now and spoke with a flash of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it, I believe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've got to feel deeply&mdash;about
      something. I've got to have a religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, Sue. There's a fanatical strain in you. You came into the
      Village life fresh from college with a whole set of brand-new enthusiasms.
      Fanatical enthusiasms. The attitude toward life that most of us take for
      granted&mdash;like it, feel it, just because it is us&mdash;you came at us
      like a wild young Columbus. You hadn't always believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always resented parental authority,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Yes, I know. I'm not
      sure your revolt wasn't more a personal reaction than a social theory.
      They tried to tie you down. Your father&mdash;well, the less said about
      him the letter. Preaching that old, old, false stuff, commercializing it,
      stifling your growth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let's discuss him, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. But the home was a conspiracy against you. His present wife
      isn't your mother, you told me once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she isn't my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, thinking hard&mdash;&ldquo;look here, Sue, what in
      thunder are you to do! You're no good without that mainspring, that
      faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, studying the table between them&mdash;silent, sober, not
      hostile. Life was not a joyous crusade; it was a grim dilemma. And an
      insistent pressure. She knew this now. The very admiration she felt for
      this strong man disarmed her in resisting him. He told the bald truth. She
      had fought him away once, only to involve herself with the impossible
      Peter; an experience that now left her the weaker before him. He knew
      this, of course. And he was a man to use every resource in getting what he
      wanted. There was little to object to in him, if you accepted him at all.
      And she had accepted him. As in a former crisis between them, he made her
      feel a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It brings me back to the old topic, Sue. I could help you, if you could
      let me. You have fought love down. You tried to compromise on marriage.
      Nothing in that. Better live your life, girl! You've got to keep on. You
      can't conceivably marry Peter; you can't drift along here without a spark
      alight in you, fighting life; you can't go back home, licked. God knows
      you can't do that! Give me a chance Sue. Try me. Stop this crazy
      resistance to your own vital needs. Damn it, be human!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue, lips compressed, eyes misty, color rising a little, looked up,
      avoided Zanin's eyes; gazed as he had been doing, about the room. And
      coming in through the wide door she saw the long figure of Henry Bates,
      whom friends called the Worm. She watched him, compressing her lips a
      little more, knitting her brows, while he stood looking from table to
      table. His calm face, unassertive, reflective, whimsical in the slight
      squint of the eyes, was deeply reassuring. She was fond of Henry Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came across the room; greeted Zanin briefly; gripped Sue's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Henry,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment, considering the two of them, then took the chair a
      waiter slid forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm here on a curious mission, Sue,&rdquo; he said. She felt the touch of
      solemnity in his voice and gave him a quick glance. &ldquo;I've been sent to
      find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rdquo;&mdash;said she, all nerves&mdash;&ldquo;what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident At your home, Sue. They believe that your father is dying. He
      has asked for you. It was a neighbor who called&mdash;a Mr. Deems&mdash;and
      from what little he could tell me I should say that you are needed there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands moved nervously; she threw them out in the quick way she had and
      started to speak; then giving it up let them drop and pushed back her
      chair. For the moment she seemed to see neither man: her gaze went past
      them; her mouth twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanin sat back, smoked, looked from one to the other. He was suddenly out
      of it. He had never known a home, in Russia or America. There was
      something between Henry Rates and Sue Wilde, a common race memory, a
      strain in their spiritual fiber that he did not share; something he could
      not even guess at. Whatever it was he could see it gripping her, touching
      and rousing hidden depths. So much her face told him. He kept silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him now. &ldquo;You'll excuse me, Jacob?&rdquo; she said, very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going, then?&rdquo; said he. He was true to his creed. There was no
      touch of conventional sentiment in his voice. He had despised everything
      her father's life meant; he despised it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and nodded with sudden nervous energy&mdash;a rising
      color in her cheeks, her head erect, shoulders stiffened, a flash in her
      eyes&mdash;such a flash as no one had seen there for a long time&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      I'm going&mdash;home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanin sat alone, looking after them as they walked quietly out of the
      restaurant. He lighted a fresh cigarette, deliberately blew out the match,
      stared at it as if it had been a live thing, then flicked it over his
      shoulder with a snap of his thumb.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;AT THE CORNER OF TENTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER sat alone in
      the corner room downstairs. Mechanically he turned the pages of <i>Le
      Sourire</i>&mdash;turned them forward and back, tried to see what lay
      before his eyes, tried indeed, to appear as should appear that well-known
      playwright, &ldquo;Eric&rdquo; Mann. &ldquo;I must think objectively,&rdquo; he told himself.
      &ldquo;That's the great thing&mdash;to think objectively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time was passing&mdash;minutes, hours, years. He was trying to think out
      how long it had been since the Worm went up-stairs. &ldquo;Was it one minute or
      ten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden new noise outside&mdash;a voice. He listened intently.
      It was Hy Lowe's voice; excited, incoherent, shouting imprecations of some
      sort. Somebody ought to take Hy home. On any occasion short of the present
      crisis he would do it himself. Gradually the voice died down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the side-street door open and close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some One had entered the barroom. He tipped back and peered out there. He
      could see part of a bulky back, a familiarly bulky back. It moved over a
      little. It was the back of Sumner Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter got up, turned, then stood irresolute. It was not, he told himself,
      that he was afraid of Sumner Smith, only that the mere sight of the man
      stirred uncomfortable and wild emotions within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to get out, in fact the only way now, was through the
      adjoining room to the door under the front steps. Certainly he couldn't go
      up-stairs. There might be trouble on the Avenue if the Worm should see him
      coming out. For a moment he even considered swallowing down all this
      outrageous emotional upheaval within him and staying there. He had said
      that Sue would send for him. During ten or twelve seconds out of every
      sixty he firmly believed she would. It was so in his plays&mdash;let the
      heartless girl, in her heyday, jilt a worthy lover, she was sure in her
      hours of trial to flee, chastened, to his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he looked again at the back of Sumner Smith. It was a solid back. It
      suggested, like the man's inscrutable round face, quiet power. Peter
      decided on flight via that front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly across the room. Then he heard a voice that chilled his
      hot blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mann,&rdquo; said this voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned. One or two men glanced up from their papers, then went on
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stood wavering. Sumner Smith's eye was full on him from the barroom
      door; Sumner Smith's head was beckoning him with a jerk. He went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll you have?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly, in the barroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll I have?&rdquo; mimicked Sumner Smith in a voice of rumbling calm.
      &ldquo;You're good, Maun. But if anybody was to buy, it'd be me. The joke, you
      see, is on me. Only nobody's buying at the moment. You send me out&mdash;an
      <i>Evening Earth</i> man!&mdash;to pull off a murder for the morning
      papers. Oh, it's good! I grant you, it's good. I do your little murder;
      the morning papers get the story. Just to make sure of it you send Jimmie
      Markham around after me. It's all right, Mann. I've done your murder. <i>The
      Continental's</i> getting the story now&mdash;a marvel of a story. There's
      a page in it for them to-morrow. As for you&mdash;I don't know what you
      are. And I don't care to soil any of the words I know by putting 'em on
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Peter now caught the rumble beneath the calm surface of that voice.
      And he knew it was perhaps the longest speech of Sumner Smith's eventful
      life. Peter's stomach, heart, lungs and spine seemed to drop out of his
      body, leaving a cold hollow frame that could hardly be strong enough to
      support his shoulders and head. But he drew himself up and replied with
      some dignity in a voice that was huskier and higher than his own:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't match you in insults, Smith. I appear to have a choice between
      leaving you and striking you. I shall leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The choice is yours,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Either you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you,&rdquo; repeated Peter; and walked, very erect, out to the
      side street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, near the corner of the Avenue, he found Hy Lowe, leaning against the
      building, weeping, while four taxi chauffeurs and two victoria drivers
      stood by. It occurred to Peter that it might, be best, after all, to give
      up brooding over his own troubles and take the boy home. He could bundle
      him into a taxi. And once at the old apartment building in the Square,
      John the night man would help carry him up. It would be rather decent, for
      that matter, to pay for the taxi just as if it was a matter of course and
      never mention it to Hy. Of course, however, if Hy were to remember the
      occurrence&mdash;A fist landed in Peter's face&mdash;not a hard fist,
      merely a limp, folded-over hand. Peter brushed it aside. It was the fist
      of Hy Lowe. Hy lurched at him now, caught his shoulders, tried to shake
      him. He was saying things in a rapidly rising voice. After a moment of
      ineffectual wrestling, Peter began to catch what these things were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call yourself frien'&mdash;take bread outa man's mouth! Oh, I know. No
      good tryin' lie to me&mdash;tellin' me Sumner Smith don' know what he's
      talkin'! Where's my raise? You jes' tell me&mdash;where's my raise? Ol'
      Walrus gone&mdash;croaked&mdash;where's my raise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter propped him against the building and walked swiftly around the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stopped; dodged behind a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue and the Worm were running down tire wide front steps. She leaped into
      the first taxi. The Worm stood, one foot on the step, hand on door, and
      called. One of Hy's audience hurried around, brushing past Peter,
      receiving his instructions as he cranked the engine and leaped to his
      seat. The door slammed. They were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was sure that something snapped in his brain. It was probably a
      lesion, he thought. He strode blindly, madly, up the Avenue, crowding past
      the other pedestrians, bumping into one man and rushing on without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly&mdash;this was a little farther up the Avenue&mdash;Peter stopped
      short, caught his breath, struggled with emotions that even he would have
      thought mixed. He even turned and walked back a short way. For across the
      street, back in the shadow of the corner building, his eyes made out the
      figure of a girl; and he knew that figure, knew the slight droop of the
      shoulders and the prise of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen him, of course. Yes, this was Tenth Street! With swift
      presence of mind he stooped and went through the motion of picking up
      something from the sidewalk. This covered his brief retreat. He advanced
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung back in the shadow of the building. Her dark pretty face was
      clouded with anger, her breast rose and fell quickly with her breathing.
      She would not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her arm&mdash;her softly rounded arm&mdash;in his hand. She
      wrenched it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Maria, dear,&rdquo; he murmured rather weakly. &ldquo;I'm sorry I kept you
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She confronted him now. There was passion in her big eyes. Her voice was
      not under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you tell the truth?&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;You think you can do
      anything with me&mdash;play with me, hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Maria!&rdquo; He caught her arm again. &ldquo;Some one will hear you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I care? Do you think I don't know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, I don't know what on earth you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do know! You play with me! You sent for your bags. Why didn't you
      come yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you saw me here you stopped&mdash;you went back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gulped. &ldquo;I dropped my keys,&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;I was swinging them.
      I had to go back and pick them up.&rdquo; And triumphantly, with his free hand,
      he produced them from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the grip of his other hand he felt her soft arm tremble a little.
      Her gaze drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't just to-night&mdash;&rdquo; he heard her trying to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear, here's a bus! We'll ride up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let him lead her to the curb. Solicitously he handed her up the
      winding little stairway to a seat on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no one book of Peter's life. There are a great many little books,
      some of them apparently unconnected with any of the others. Maria
      Tonifetti, as you may gather from this unintelligible little scene on a
      street corner, had one of those detached Peter books all to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up on the roof of the bus, Peter, reacting with great inner excitement
      from his experiences of the last three hours, slipped an arm about Maria's
      shoulders, bent tenderly over her, whispered softly into her ear. Before
      the bus reached Forty-second Street he had the satisfaction of feeling her
      nestle softly and comfortably against his arm, and he knew that once again
      he had won her. Slowly within his battered spirit the old thrill of
      conquest stirred and flamed up into a warm glow....

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX&mdash;FIFTY MINUTES FROM BROADWAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Worm sat on a
      wooden chair, an expression of puzzled gravity on his usually whimsical
      face. The room was a small kitchen. The two screened windows gave a view
      of a suburban yard, bounded by an alley and beyond the alley other yards;
      beyond these a row of small frame houses. There were trees; and the scent
      of a honeysuckle vine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue Wilde, her slim person enveloped in a checked apron, knelt by the
      old-fashioned coal range. The lower door was open, the ash-pan drawn half
      out. There were ashes on the floor about her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Bates absently drew out his old caked brier pipe; filled and lighted
      it. Meditatively he studied the girl&mdash;her apron, the flush on her
      face, the fascinating lights in her tousled hair&mdash;telling himself
      that the scene was real, that the young rebel soul he had known in the
      Village was this same Sue Wilde. The scent of the honeysuckle floated
      thickly to his nostrils. He stared out at the row of little wooden houses.
      He slowly shook his head; and his teeth closed hard on the pipe stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she cried softly, throwing out her fine hands, &ldquo;don't you
      understand! I had a conscience all the time. That's what was the matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand well enough, Sue,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's the&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked again about the kitchen and out the window&mdash;&ldquo;it's the setting!
      I hadn't pictured you as swinging so far to this extreme Though, as you
      know, there in the Village, I have been rather conservative in my feelings
      about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Henry.&rdquo; She settled back on her heels. He saw how subdued she
      was. The tears were not far from her eyes. &ldquo;I've been all wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. In all I said and tried to do in the Village.&rdquo; He was shaking
      his head; but she continued: &ldquo;I was cutting at the roots of my own life. I
      disowned every spiritual obligation. I put my faith in Nietzsche and the
      Russian crowd, in egotism. Henry&rdquo;'&mdash;her eyes unmistakably filled
      now'; her voice grew unsteady&mdash;&ldquo;once my father came over into the
      Village after me. He tried to get me to come home. I was playing at the
      Crossroads then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he shortly, &ldquo;I remember that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had on my boy costume. He came straight to the theater and I had to go
      out front and talk with him. We quarreled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he quickly, &ldquo;I was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw that she was in the grip of an emotional revulsion and wished he
      could stop her. But he couldn't. Suddenly she seemed like a little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see, Henry!&rdquo; She threw out her hands. &ldquo;Do you think it would be
      any good&mdash;now&mdash;to tell me I'm not partly responsible. If I&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
       she caught herself, stiffened up; there was a touch of her old
      downrightness in the way she came out with, &ldquo;Henry, he wouldn't have&mdash;killed
      himself!&rdquo; Her voice was a whisper. &ldquo;He wouldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm smoked and smoked. He couldn't tell her that he regarded her
      father as a hypocritical old crook, and that her early revolt against the
      home within which the man had always wished to confine her had, as he saw
      it, grown out of a sound instinct. You couldn't expect her, now, to get
      all that into any sort of perspective. Her revolt dated back to her
      girlish struggle to get away to school and later, to college. Sue was
      forgetting now how much of this old story she had let him see in their
      many talks. Why, old Wilde had tried to change the course of her college
      studies to head her away from modernism into the safer channels of
      pietistic tradition. The Worm couldn't forgive him for that. And then, the
      man's dreadful weekly, and his curious gift of using his great emotional
      power to draw immense sums of money from thousands of faithful readers in
      small towns and along country lanes, he hadn't killed himself on Sue's
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was known, now, that the man had lived in an awful fear. It was known
      that he had the acid right at hand in both office and home, the acid he
      had finally drunk.... She was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm smoked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you really know what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he repeated, all at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have seen the drift of it&mdash;of what I didn't tell you at one
      time or another.&rdquo; He saw now that she was talking of her own experiences.
      He had to make a conscious struggle to bring his mind up out of those ugly
      depths and listen to her. She went on. &ldquo;It has been fine, Henry, the way I
      could always talk to you. Our friendship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began in another way. &ldquo;It's the one thing I owe to Jacob Zanin. He
      told me the blunt truth&mdash;about myself. It did hurt, Henry. But even
      then I knew it for the truth.... You know how he feels about marriage and
      the home&rdquo;&mdash;she glanced up at the bare kitchen walls&mdash;&ldquo;all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&mdash;Henry, he wanted to have an affair with me.&rdquo; She said this
      rather hurriedly and low, not at all with the familiar frankness of the
      Village in discussing the old forbidden topics. &ldquo;He knew I was all
      confused, that I had got into an impasse. He made me see that I'd been
      talking and thinking a kind of freedom that I hadn't the courage to go in
      for, really&mdash;in living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, courage&mdash;or taste&mdash;-or something! Henry, you know as well
      as I that the freedom we talk in the Village leads straight to&mdash;well,
      to complete unmorality, to&mdash;to promiscuity, to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, watching her and wondering with a little glow suddenly
      warming his heart, at her lack of guile. He thought of a phrase he had
      once formulated while hearing this girl talk&mdash;-&ldquo;Whom among women the
      gods would destroy they first make honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was put to the test&mdash;and I <i>was</i> put to the test, Henry;
      I found that I was caught in my own philosophy, was drifting down with it&mdash;if
      turned out that I simply didn't believe the things I'd been saying. I
      even&rdquo;&mdash;she faltered here, but rushed on&mdash;&ldquo;I very nearly rushed
      into a crazy marriage with Peter. Just to save myself. Oh, I see it now!
      It would have been as dishonest a marriage as the French-heeledest little
      suburbanite ever planned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're severe with yourself,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, lips compressed, shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he mused aloud, &ldquo;there's a lot of us radicals who'd be
      painfully put to it if we were suddenly called on to quit talking and
      begin really living it out. Lord, what would we do!&rdquo; And mentally he
      added: &ldquo;Damn few of us would make the honest effort to find ourselves that
      you're making right now.&rdquo; Then, aloud: &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her eyes. &ldquo;I'm going to take these ashes down cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do that,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the small task was accomplished, she said more gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, please understand! I count on you. This thing is a tragedy. I'm
      deep in it. I don't even want to escape it. I'll try not to sink into
      those morbid thoughts&mdash;but he was my father, and he was buried
      yesterday. His wife, this one, is not my mother, but&mdash;but she was his
      wife. She is crushed, Henry. I have never before been close to a human
      being who was shattered as she is shattered. There are the children&mdash;two
      of them. And no money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father's creditors have seized the paper and the house in Stuyvesant
      Square. Everything is tied up. There is to be an investigation. My Aunt
      Matilda is here&mdash;this is her house&mdash;-but we can't ask her to
      support us. Henry, here is something you can do! Betty is staying at my
      old rooms. Try to see her to-day. Could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have her get some one to come in with her&mdash;take the place off my
      hands. Every cent of the little I have is needed here. She'll be staying.
      That marriage of hers didn't work. She couldn't keep away from the
      Village, anyway. And please have her pack up my things and send them out.
      I only brought a hand-bag. Betty will pitch in and do that for me. She's
      got to. I haven't even paid this month's rent yet. Have her send
      everything except my books&mdash;perhaps she could sell those. It would
      help a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard a step on the uncarpeted back stairs. A door swung open. On the
      bottom step, framed in the shadowed doorway, stood a short
      round-shouldered woman. Lines drooped downward from her curving mouth. Her
      colorless eyes shifted questioningly from the girl to the man and back to
      the girl again. It was an unimaginative face, rather grim, telling its own
      story of fifty-odd years of devotion to petty household and neighborhood
      duties; the face of a woman all of whose girlhood impulses had been
      suppressed until they were converted into perverse resentments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, as he rose, hardly aware of the act, knocked the ashes from his
      pipe into the coal hod. Then he saw that her eyes were on those ashes and
      on his pipe. He thrust the pipe into his pocket. And glancing from the
      woman to the girl, he momentarily held his breath at the contrast and the
      thoughts it raised. It was youth and crabbed age. The gulf between them
      was unbridgeable, of course; but he wondered&mdash;it was a new thought&mdash;if
      age need be crabbed. Didn't the new sprit of freedom, after all, have as
      much to contribute to life, as the puritan tradition? Were the risks of
      letting yourself go any greater, after all, than the risks of suppression?
      Weren't the pseudo-Freudians at least partly right?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Matilda,&rdquo; Sue was saying (on her feet now)&mdash;&ldquo;this is an old
      friend, Mr. Bates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Bales, his moment of speculation past, felt his spirit sinking. He
      said nothing, because he could think of nothing that could be said to a
      woman who looked like that. She brought with her the close air of the
      stricken chamber at the top of the stairs. By merely opening the door and
      appearing there she had thrust a powerful element of hostility into the
      simple little kitchen. Her uncompromising eyes drew Sue within the tragic
      atmosphere of the house as effectively and definitely as it thrust himself
      without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue's next remark was even more illuminating than had been his own curious
      haste to conceal his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Sue, &ldquo;have we disturbed&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated, fought with
      herself, came out with it&mdash;-&ldquo;mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the smoke annoys her.&rdquo; Aunt Matilda did not add the word
      &ldquo;naturally,&rdquo; but the tone and look conveyed it. &ldquo;And she can hear your
      voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Bates had to struggle with a rising anger. There were implications
      in that queerly hostile look that reflected on Sue as on himself. But they
      were and remained unspoken. They could not be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only possible course was to go; and to go with the miserable feeling
      that he was surrendering Sue to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her now, speaking with quiet dignity; little realizing that
      even this dignity aroused resentment and suspicion in the unreceptive mind
      behind those eyes on the stairs&mdash;that it looked brazen coming from a
      young man whose sandy hair straggled down over his ears and close to his
      suspiciously soft collar, whose clothes were old and wrinkled, whose mild
      studious countenance exhibited nothing of the vigor and the respect for
      conformity that are expected of young men in suburbs who must go in every
      morning on the seven-thirty-six and come out every evening on the
      five-fifty-two, and who, therefore, would naturally be classed with such
      queer folk as gipsies and actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, Sue,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll get Betty to hurry so I can bring a
      suit-case out to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a brief moment before answering; and in that moment was swept
      finally within Aunt Matilda's lines. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said, speaking with
      sudden rapidity, &ldquo;don't do that. To-morrow will do&mdash;just send them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then aware that she was dismissing him indefinitely, her eyes brimming
      again (for he had been a good friend), she extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm gripped it, bowed to the forbidding figure on the stairs and
      left.

      CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;A PAIR OF RED BOOTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE pleasant days
      of quiet reading and whimsical reflection were over for the Worm, poor
      devil! Life caught him up without warning&mdash;that complex fascinating
      life of which he had long been a spectator&mdash;and swept him into swift
      deep currents. He was to be a mere spectator no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington Square glowed with June. The trees had not yet assumed the
      faded, dispirited gray-green of midsummer. The bus tops were crowded with
      pleasure riders, and a crowd of them pressed about the open-air terminal
      station held in check by uniformed guards. On the wide curves of asphalt
      hundreds of small Italians danced to the hurdy-gurdy or played hopscotch
      or roller-skated. Perambulators lined the shady walks; nurses, slim and
      uniformed, fat and unformed, lined the benches. Students hurried west,
      south and north (for it was afternoon&mdash;Saturday afternoon, as it
      happened). Beggars, pedlers, lovers in pairs, unkempt tenement dwellers, a
      policeman or two, moved slowly about, but not so slowly as they would move
      a few weeks later when the heat of July would have sapped the vitality of
      every living thing in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Worm, standing near the marble arch where Fifth Avenue splendidly
      begins, felt not June in his heart. He walked on through the Square to the
      old red-brick building where for three years he and Hy Lowe and Pcter
      Ericson Mann had dwelt in bachelor comfort. The dingy studio apartment on
      the seventh floor had been his home. But it was a haunt of discord now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the usually effervescent Hy pacing the lower hall like a leopard
      in a cage. Hy wore an immaculately pressed suit of creamy gray flannel,
      new red tie, red silk hosiery visible above the glistening low-cut tan
      shoes, a Panama hat with a fluffy striped band around it. In his hand was
      a thin bamboo stick which he was swinging savagely against his legs. His
      face worked with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pounced upon the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted to see you,&rdquo; he said in a voice that was low but of quavering
      intensity. &ldquo;Before I go. Got to run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the elevator came creaking down. A messenger boy stepped
      out, carrying Hy's suit-case and light overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; breathed Hy, &ldquo;one minute.&rdquo; He whispered to the boy, pressed a
      folded dollar bill into his hand, hurried him off. &ldquo;This thing has become
      flatly impossible&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; The Worm was moodily surveying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete. He's up there now. I'm through. I shan't go into those rooms again
      if he&mdash;look here! I've found a place for you and me, over in the
      Mews. Eight dollars less than this and more light. Tell Pete. I. can't
      talk to him. My God, the man's a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a what?&rdquo; asked the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what he <i>did!</i> As there's a God in the Heavens he
      killed old Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed your aunt!&rdquo; observed the Worm, and soberly considered his friend.
      Hy's elaborate get-up suggested the ladies, a particular lady. The Worm
      looked him over again from the fluff-bound Panama to the red silk socks. A
      very particular lady! And he was speaking with wandering eyes and an
      unreal sort of emphasis; as if his anger, though doubtless genuine enough,
      were confused with some other emotion regarding which he was not explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going now&mdash;over to the Mews?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy started at the abrupt question, took the Worm's elbow, became suddenly
      confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not exactly. You see&mdash;everything's gone to smash. The
      creditors of the paper won't keep me on. They'll put in a country preacher
      with a string tie, and he'll bring his own staff. That's what Pete's done
      to me! That's what he's done. I wouldn't go off this way, right now, if it
      wasn't for the awful depression I feel. I didn't sleep a wink last night.
      Honest, not a wink! A man's got to have <i>some</i> sympathy in his life.
      Damn it, in a crisis like this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me with even greater lucidity when you are coming
      back,&rdquo; said the Worm dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy gulped, stared blankly at his friend, uttered explosively the one word,
      &ldquo;Monday!&rdquo; Then he glanced at his watch and hurried out of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm slowly shook his head and took the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long dim studio was quite as usual, with its soft-toned walls,
      dilapidated but comfortable furniture, Hy's piano, the decrepit flat-top
      desk, the two front windows from which you could see all of the Square and
      the mile of roofs beyond it, and still beyond, the heights of New Jersey.
      The coffee percolator stood on the bookcase&mdash;on the empty bookcase
      where once had been the Worm's library. In this room he had studied and
      written the hundreds of futile book reviews that nobody ever heard of,
      that had got him precisely nowhere. In this room he had lived in a state
      of soul near serenity until he met Sue Wilde. Now it brought heartache.
      Merely to push open the door and step within was to stir poignantly
      haunting memories of a day that was sharply gone. It was like opening old
      letters. The scent of a thoughtlessly happy past was faintly there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something else was there&mdash;a human object, sprawled abjectly in the
      Morris chair, garbed in slippers and bathrobe, hair disheveled, but
      black-rimmed eye-glasses still on his nose, the conspicuous black ribbon
      still hanging from them down the long face. It was that well-known
      playwright, Peter Ericson Mann, author of <i>The Buzzard, Odd Change and
      Anchored</i>; and, more recently, of the scenario for Jacob Zanin's Nature
      him. Author, too, of the new satirical comedy. <i>The Triffler</i>,
      written at Sue Wilde and booked for production in September at the Astoria
      Theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm had not told Hy that he had just seen Sue. Now, standing
      motionless, the thousand memory-threads that bound the old rooms to his
      heart clinging there like leafless ivy, he looked down at the white-faced
      man in the Morris chair and knew that he was even less likely to mention
      the fact to Peter. He thought&mdash;&ldquo;Why, we're not friends! That's what
      it means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's hollow eyes were on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Worm!&rdquo; he said huskily, and tried to smile. &ldquo;I'm rather ill, I
      think. It's shock. You know a shock can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shocked you?&rdquo; asked Henry Bates rather shortly, turning to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hy. He's crazy, I think. It's the only possible explanation. He said I
      was a&rdquo;&mdash;Peter's expressive voice dropped, more huskily still, into
      the tragic mood&mdash;&ldquo;a murderer. It was a frightful experience. The boy
      has gone batty. It's his fear of losing his job, of course. But the
      experience has had a curious effect on me. My heart is palpitating.&rdquo; His
      right hand was feeling for the pulse in his left wrist. &ldquo;And I have some,
      difficulty in breathing.&rdquo; Now he pressed both hands to his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm stared out the window. Peter would act until his dying day; even
      then. One pose would follow another, prompted by the unstable emotions of
      genius, guided only by an egotism so strong that it would almost certainly
      weather every storm of brain or soul. In a very indirect way Pete had
      murdered the old boy. No getting around that. An odd sort of murder&mdash;sending
      Sumner Smith to ask that question. Peter himself, away down under his
      egotism, knew it. Hence the play for sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was still talking. &ldquo;It really came out of a clear sky. Until very
      lately I should have said that Hy and I were friends. As you know, we had
      many points of contact. Last fall, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm turned. &ldquo;Passing lightly over the next eight months,&rdquo; he
      remarked, &ldquo;what do you propose to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrank back a little. The Worm's manner was hardly ingratiating.
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why, I suppose I'll stay on here. You and I have
      always got on, Henry. We've been comfortable here. And to tell the truth,
      I've been getting tired of listening to the history in detail of Hy's
      amours. He wants to look out, that fellow. He's had a few too many of 'em.
      He's getting careless. Now you and I, we're both sober, quiet. We were the
      backbone of the Seventh-Story Men. We can go on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, though given to dry and sometimes cryptic ways, was never rude.
      That is he never had been. But at this point he walked out of the
      apartment and closed the door behind him. He had come in with the
      intention of using the telephone. Instead now he walked swiftly through
      the Square and on across Sixth Avenue, under the elevated road into
      Greenwich Village, where the streets twist curiously, and the hopeless
      poor swarm in the little triangular parks, and writers and painters and
      sculptors and agitators and idea-venders swarm in the quaint tumble-down
      old houses and the less quaint apartment buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered one of the latter, pressed one of a row of buttons under a row
      of brass mouthpieces. The door clicked. He opened it; walked through to
      the rear door on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This door opened slowly, disclosing a tall young woman, very light in
      coloring, of a softly curving outline, seeming to bend and sway even as
      she stood quietly there; charming to the eye even in the half-light, fresh
      of skin, slow, non-committal in speech and of quietly yielding ways; a
      young woman with large, almost beautiful, inexpressive eyes. She wore hat
      and gloves and carried a light coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just caught me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor by the wall was a hand-bag. Henry Bates eyed this. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he
      murmured, distrait, &ldquo;going away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes. You wanted me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's about Sue Wilde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; then led him into the half-furnished living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Sue, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left her she wras trying to make a fire in a kitchen range. Out in
      Jersey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble was she didn't understand about the damper in the pipe. I fixed
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty glanced covertly at her wrist watch. &ldquo;I don't want to appear
      unsympathetic,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I don't see why she undertakes to shoulder
      that family. It's&mdash;it's quixotic. It's not her sort of thing. She's
      got her own life to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, very calm but a little white about the mouth, confronted her.
      Betty moved restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants you to pack up her things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sent me to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty knit her brows. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;isn't that too bad. I really
      haven't a minute. You see&mdash;it's a matter of catching a train. I could
      do it Monday. Or you might call up one of the other girls. I'm awfully
      sorry. But it's something very important.&rdquo; Her eyes avoided his. Her color
      rose a little. She turned away. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she was murmuring, &ldquo;I hate
      terribly to fail Sue at a time like this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved irresolutely toward the little hall, glanced again at her watch;
      and suddenly in confusion picked up her bag and hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear her light step in the outer corridor; then the street door.
      All at sea, he started to follow. At the apartment door he paused. Her key
      was in the lock; she had not even thought to take it. He removed it, put
      it in his pocket; then wandered back into the living-room and stood over
      the telephone, trying to think of some one he could call in. But his
      rising resentment made clear thinking difficult. He sank into the
      armchair, crossed his long legs, clasped his hands behind his head, stared
      at the mantel. On it were Sue's books, in a haphazard row&mdash;a few
      Russian novels (in English translations), Havelock Ellis's <i>Sex in
      Relation to Society, Freud on Psychanalysis and Dreams</i>, two volumes of
      Schnitzler's plays, Brieux's plays with the Shaw preface, a few others.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze roved from the books to the bare walls. They <i>were</i> bare;
      all Sue's pictures were pinned up on the burlap screen that hid a corner
      of the room&mdash;half a dozen feminist cartoons from <i>The Masses</i>, a
      futuristic impression of her own head by one of the Village artists, two
      or three strong rough sketches by Jacob Zanin of costumes for a playlet at
      the Crossroads, an English lithograph of Mrs. Pankhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Bates slowly, thoughtfully, filled and lighted his pipe. His brows
      were knit. The room, in its unfeminine bareness as well as in its pictures
      and books, breathed of the modern unsubmissive girl. No one had wasted a
      minute here on &ldquo;housekeeping.&rdquo; Here had lived the young woman who, more,
      perhaps, than any other of the recent lights of the old Village, had
      typified revolt. She had believed, like the Village about her, not in
      patriotism but in internationalism, not in the home but in the individual,
      not in duty and submission, but in experiment and self-expression.
      Already, like all the older faiths of men, this new religion had its cant,
      its intolerance of opposition, its orthodoxy. His pipe went out while he
      sat there flunking about it; the beginnings of the summer twilight
      softened the harsh room and dimmed the outlines of back fences and rear
      walls without the not overclean windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he got up, turned on the lights, took off his coat, found Sue's
      trunk behind the burlap screen and dragged it to the middle of the room.
      He began with the coverings of the couch-bed; then went into the bedroom
      and folded blankets, coverlet, sheets and comforter. Sue did not own a
      great variety of clothing; but what was hanging in the closet he brought
      out, folded and packed away. He took down the few pictures and laid them
      flat within the upper tray of the trunk. In an hour living-room, bedroom
      and closet were bare. The books he piled by the door; first guessing at
      the original cost of each and adding the figures in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remained but the bureau in the bedroom. He stood before this a
      long moment before he could bring himself to open the top drawer. To
      Peter, to Zanin, to Hy Howe, the matter would have been simple. Years back
      those deeply experienced young bachelors had become familiar with all
      manner of little feminine mysteries; but to Henry Bates these were
      mysteries still. The color came hotly to his mild countenance; his pulses
      beat faster and faster. He recalled with painful vividness, the last
      occasion on which Reason, normally his God, had deserted him. That was the
      day, not so long ago by the calendar, he had turned against all that had
      been his life&mdash;dropped his books in the North River, donned the
      costly new suit that Peter's tailor had made for him and set forth to
      propose marriage to Sue Wilde. And with chagrin that grew and burned his
      face to a hotter red he recalled that he had never succeeded in making
      himself clear to her. To this day she did not know that his reflective,
      emotionally unsophisticated heart had been torn with love of her. Why,
      blindly urging marriage, he had actually talked her into that foolish
      engagement with Peter!... What was the quality that enabled men to advance
      themselves&mdash;in work, in love? Whatever it might be, he felt he had it
      not. Peter had it. Zanin had it. Hy had it. Sue herself! Each was a
      person, something of a force, a positive quality in life. But he, Henry
      Bates, was a negative thing. For years he had sat quietly among his books,
      content to watch others forge past him and disappear up the narrow lanes
      of progress. Until now, at thirty-two, he found himself a hesitant
      unfruitful man without the gift of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a gift,&rdquo; he said aloud; and then sat on the springs of the stripped
      bed and stared at his ineffectual face in the mirror. &ldquo;The trouble with
      me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is plain lack of character. Better Hy's trifling
      conquests; better Zanin's driving instinct to get first; better Peter's
      hideously ungoverned ego; than&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pipe usually helped. He felt for it. It was not in the right-hand coat
      pocket where he always carried it. Which fact startled him. Then he found
      it in the left-hand pocket. Not once in ten years before this bitter hour
      had he misplaced his pipe. &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;haven't I even got any
      <i>habits!</i>&rdquo; He was unnerved. &ldquo;Like Pete,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but without
      even Pete's excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lighted his pipe, puffed a moment, stood erect, drew a few deep
      breaths, then drove himself at the task of packing the things that were in
      the bureau. And a task it was! Nothing but the strong if latent will of
      the man held him to it. There were soft white garments the like of which
      his hands had never touched before. Reverently, if grimly, he laid them
      away in the upper trays of the trunk. In the bottom drawer were Sue's
      dancing costumes&mdash;Russian and Greek. Each one of these brought a
      vivid picture of the girl as she had appeared at the Crossroads; each was
      a stab at Henry Bates' heart. At the bottom, in the corner, were a pair of
      red leather boots, very light, with metal clicks in the heels. He took
      them up, stood motionless holding them. His eyes filled. He could see her
      again, in that difficult crouching Russian step&mdash;her costume
      sparkling with color, her olive skin tinted rose with the spirited
      exercise of it, her extraordinary green eyes dancing with the exuberant
      life that was in her. Then, as if by a trick shift of scene, he saw her in
      a bare kitchen, wearing a checked apron, kneeling by a stove. The tears
      brimmed over. He lifted the little red boots, stared wildly at them,
      kissed them over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he moaned softly, &ldquo;oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint smell of burning. His pipe lay at his feet, sparks had
      fallen out and were eating their way into the matting. He stepped on them;
      then picked up the pipe and resolutely lighted it again. The boots he
      carried into the living-room; found an old newspaper and wrapped them up;
      laid the parcel by his hat and coat in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a strap in the kitchen closet and strapped the trunk. There was a
      suit-case that he had filled; he closed this and laid it on the trunk.
      Then he turned all the lights off and stood looking out the open window.
      He had had no dinner&mdash;couldn't conceivably eat any. It was evening
      now; somewhere between eight and nine o'clock, probably. He didn't care.
      Nothing mattered, beyond getting trunk and suit-case off to Sue before too
      late&mdash;so that she would surely have them in the morning. The sounds
      of evening in the city floated to his ears; and he realized that he had
      not before been hearing them. From an apartment across the area came the
      song of a talking machine. Blowsy women leaned out of rear windows and
      visited. There was a faint tinkle from a mechanical piano in the corner
      saloon. He could hear a street-car going by on Tenth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then another sound&mdash;steps in the corridor; the turning of a knob;
      fumbling at the apartment door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started like a guilty man. In the Village, it was nothing for a man to
      be in a girl's rooms or a girl in a man's. The group was too well
      emancipated for that&mdash;in theory, at least. In fact, of course,
      difficulties often arose&mdash;and gossip. Greathearted phrases were the
      common tender of Village talk; but not all the talkers were great-hearted.
      And women suffered while they smiled. He would have preferred not to be
      found there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key grated. The door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shrinking at his heart, a sudden great selfconsciousness, he
      stepped into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sue&mdash;in her old street suit.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UE stared at him,
      caught her breath, laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Henry! You startled me. Where's Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, thinking quickly, bitterness in his heart against the selfish
      lightness of the Village, bed. &ldquo;Haven't seen her. Waited for her to come
      in. Finally decided I'd better not wait any longer.&rdquo; They were in the dim
      living-room now. Sue's eyes took in the strapped trunk and closed
      suit-case, the bare screen and couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who&mdash;Henry, you don't mean that you&mdash;&rdquo; He nodded. His pipe
      was out&mdash;he simply couldn't keep it going! Still, it gave him
      something to do, lighting it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue stood watching him, studying his face by the light of a match
      reflected from his hollowed hands. &ldquo;Why so dark in here?&rdquo; she observed.
      Then, abruptly, she came to him, laid a hand on his arm, broke out with
      feeling: &ldquo;You're a dear, Henry, to go to all this trouble! As it was, I
      felt I was imposing on you. So I ran in to look after things myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going back to-night?&rdquo; he asked, talking around his pipe-stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. yes. I must.&rdquo; She moved to the window and gazed out at the crowded
      familiar scene. Suddenly she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry&mdash;didn't you see Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how on earth did you get in? There are only the two keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his pipe, stared at her with open mouth. As soon as his mind
      cleared a little he thought&mdash;&ldquo;Good God! I don't even lie well! I'm no
      good&mdash;for anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned with a jerk; walked down the room; walked back again; striding
      out savagely, turning with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you aren't felling me?&rdquo; she asked, following him with troubled
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced and paced. Finally he came to the other side of the window,
      stared gloomily out. Still she watched him, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he said&mdash;she had never known this vehemence in him&mdash;&ldquo;you're
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw out his arm in a strong gesture; his fist was clenched..The other
      hand held his pipe high. &ldquo;Yes, wrong! You're not a cook! You're not a
      nurse maid. You're a girl with a soul&mdash;with spirit&mdash;fire! What
      are you to that family? They've always wanted to hold you down&mdash;yes.
      But why? For fear you'd start talk and make them uncomfortable. Oh, I knew
      the feeling that has gripped you now. It's a big reaction. The tragedy of
      your father's death has brought your childhood back&mdash;the old tribal
      teachings&mdash;duty&mdash;self-sacrifice! The rush of it has swept your
      reason aside. But it will come back. It's got to, girl! Even if you have
      to take a long time working through to it. You and your father were not
      friends. Denying your own life won't help him. Your emotions are stirred.
      I know. But even if they are, for God's sake don't stop thinking! Keep
      your head! I tell you, you've got to go on. You can't live some one else's
      life&mdash;got to live your own! It's all you've gut to live&mdash;that
      life&mdash;your gifts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, at the point of choking. Sue was staring now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, this is strange&mdash;sounds more like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, like whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Zanin. That's the way he talked to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's the way a man talks when he&mdash;&rdquo; He could not control his
      voice and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue kept very still; but anally, softly, rather wearily, she said: &ldquo;I'm
      sorry, Henry! I've got to catch the ten-fifteen back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch; seeing nothing. &ldquo;You'll be hurrying then, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there's nearly an hour.&rdquo; She turned on the light, moved into the
      bedroom and glanced into an open bureau drawer. She drew out the one
      below, then thoughtful, half smiling, came to the door. &ldquo;Henry&mdash;-you
      packed everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, I'm sure. Though you might take a last look around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Henry, you must have packed Betty's things, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color surged up over his collar. He was thinking of those soft
      garments and the prayers that had rustled shyly upward from his torn heart
      as he felt them in his hands. Wordless, he unstrapped the trunk and lifted
      the lid. Sue repacked the trays.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking at the dancing clothes, fingering them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall never wear these again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's silly, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn't silly. I've got a job now. That's what we need, all of us&mdash;a
      job. You used to tell me that yourself. You were right.&rdquo; She was turning
      the costumes over with her slim hands. &ldquo;Did you find a pair of boots,
      Henry? Red leather with clicks in the heels? They should have been with
      these Russian things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with a sudden huskiness, &ldquo;I didn't see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's odd. They were right with the others.&rdquo; She turned away to give
      rooms and closets a final scrutiny. She brought a rough parcel in from the
      hall, feeling it with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This yours or mine, Henry?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I could swear it is those boots,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> the boots!&rdquo; he cried, like an angry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared. He waved them and her roughly aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to you, not to me. I lied to you! Take them! Pack them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brows knit, puzzled, her sensitive mouth softening painfully, she opened
      the parcel and looked at the red boots&mdash;looked more closely, held
      them up to the light; for she saw on them small round stains of a paler
      red. Slowly she raised her eyes until they met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was twisted with pain. Her own gaze grew misty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them!&rdquo; he cried in the same angry way. And she laid them in the
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was desperately fighting himself now. And with momentary success. He
      said abruptly: &ldquo;I'm going to buy your books myself, Sue. So just leave
      them there for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Henry!&rdquo; She bit her lip. &ldquo;You know I can't let you do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to let me!&rdquo; He stood right over her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;with your library&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no library.&rdquo; His voice dropped here&mdash;and he stirred, walking
      over to the window; stared out; finally turned and said, more quietly: &ldquo;Am
      I talking like a crazy man, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Henry&mdash;&rdquo; She tried to smile. &ldquo;I have always counted on your
      steadiness. Perhaps I've leaned too much on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood considering her and himself. Suddenly he confronted her again,
      raised his long arms and gripped her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Sue,&rdquo; he said, and she could fed his hands trembling with the
      passion that she heard in his voice, &ldquo;I'm failing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Henry; I won't let you say that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! And you won't say it yourself. But we both know it is true. I see it&mdash;the
      whole thing. You've had your girlish fling here in the Village. You were
      honest and natural. And you were maddeningly beautiful. We men have
      crowded about you, disturbed you, pressed you. Zanin was crazy about you.
      So was Peter. So were a lot of the others. So was I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt her shoulders stir under his strong hands. Her eyelids were
      drooping. But he could not stop. &ldquo;Everybody let it out but me. Do you know
      why I didn't? Because I was a coward. I haven't made love to women. Why?
      because I wasn't attractive to them. And I was timid. I stayed with my
      books and let life go by. Then I found myself drawn into the circle about
      you. And I lost <i>my</i> head, too. I gave up my books&mdash;-my
      'library.' Do you know where that 'library' is now, Sue? At the bottom of
      the North River. Every book! I carried them over there myself, in parcels,
      with a weight in every parcel, and dropped 'em off the ferry boat. I tried
      to go in for reality, for what is called life. I had Peter's tailor make
      me some good clothes. I got a newspaper job. Held that about two weeks.
      Tried to ask you to marry me. Oh, yes, I did. But couldn't get away with
      it. Sue, I never managed even to ask you. I talked marriage&mdash;almost
      talked you into it&mdash;but couldn't manage to talk about myself. Until
      now, just when you're worn out with work, with the pressures of men, with
      all the desperate confusions of life, when your soul is sick for peace&mdash;that's
      it, isn't it?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly her head moved. &ldquo;Yes, Henry, that's it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, I come along. And I'm the last straw. Stirring up the old
      turbulence just when you need my friendship most. I'm doing it now&mdash;this
      minute. I'm hurting you. I'm making you feel that you've lost me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry&rdquo;&mdash;he saw the effort it cost her to speak and winced&mdash;&ldquo;I
      can't bear to seem unsympathetic with you. But it's so hard. I can't see
      any way&mdash;except this of giving up self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let go her shoulders, swung away, and said: &ldquo;There's just one thing to
      do. I'll call a taxi.&rdquo; He moved to the telephone, rummaged through the
      directory, still talking, the flood of feeling that had for months been
      impounded within his emotionally inarticulate self rushing now past all
      barriers, sweeping every last protesting reticence before it. &ldquo;I do
      understand, Sue. What you feel now is as deep an urge, almost, as this old
      sex impulse that muddles life so for all Of us. It is what has driven
      millions of women into nunneries&mdash;to get away from life. Just as our
      Village freedom is a protest against, unhealthy suppression and rigidity,
      so these fevers of self-abnegation are inevitable uprushings of protest
      against animalism.&rdquo; He had found the number now. He lifted the receiver.
      &ldquo;It's Puritan against Cavalier&mdash;both right and both wrong! What
      number&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon! Bryant six thousand. It's the Greeks
      against the Greatest of Jews&mdash;both right&mdash;both wrong! Taxi,
      please! Right away. Two-thousand-twenty-six Tenth Street. All right.
      Good-by. Beauty against duty&mdash;the instinct to express against the
      instinct to serve&mdash;both right, both wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He confronted her again; caught up her two hands and gripped them within
      his own. &ldquo;You've had your little fling at expression, Sue. You were
      wonderful. You've set flowers growing in our hearts, and thank God for
      flowers! But life has trapped, you. You've swung over to service. And now
      you've got to go through, work your way out of it. God knows where you'll
      land. But if you've counted on my steadiness, by God, you may continue to
      count or it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hands to his lips; kissed her knuckles, her fingers, her
      palms; then dropped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue sank into the armchair, very white. The tears ran down her cheeks. The
      Worm could not look at her; after a moment of aimless pacing, he went out
      to the front steps of the building and, bareheaded, still coatless,
      watched for the taxi. He helped carry out the big trunk. On the ride to
      the ferry he spoke only trivialities, and Sue spoke not at all. He did not
      cross the river with her; merely, there in the ferry house, gripped her
      hand&mdash;smiling after a fashion, limp of spirit (for the first great
      emotional uprush of his life seemed to have passed like a wave) and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Sue. You'll let me help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sublet the place for you&mdash;to somebody. I'll take that on
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this, then soberly inclined her head. &ldquo;This is the key,
      Henry. Give it to Betty. And here's the key to the outer door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the two keys; dropped them into his pocket, where they jingled
      against the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lonely road you're taking, Sue. Good luck.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll see you, Henry. It won't be so exacting as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But life is going to change&mdash;for me and for you. The kaleidoscope
      won't fall again into the old combination. New crowds, new ideas, are
      coming in&mdash;new enthusiasms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Village forgets pretty easily,&rdquo; she murmured, rather wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it forgets.... Sue, you'll marry&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, lips compressed. &ldquo;No&mdash;not as I feel now....
      Henry, you're too tragic! We needn't say good-by like this. Good heavens,
      I'm only going over to Jersey&mdash;eighteen miles! That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are statute miles,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and nautical miles, and&mdash;another
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Of course, Sue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can run out&mdash;some day when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice faltered. He <i>had</i> been out of place in that kitchen. And
      she had been put to the necessity of explaining him. It was another sort
      of thing&mdash;hopelessly another sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking down at her, something of the old whimsical calm in his
      gaze, though sober, very sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said she, weakly, groping, &ldquo;you three will go on having your
      good times over there in the Square. I find I like to think of you there.
      What was it they called you&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Seventh-Story Men, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was it. You've been together so long, you three. I've always
      thought of your place as something stable in the Village. Everything else
      was changing, all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've gone like the rest, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Henry! Not really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All gone! Hy goes one way, I another. And Pete stays alone. No more
      Seventh-Story Men. Good-by, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her through the gate; waited to catch her last glance, then
      turned back into the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, very slowly, he approached the old brick building in the Square&mdash;his
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lower hall he hesitated, wondering if Peter was in. Finally he
      asked the night man. No, Mr. Mann was not in. The Worm drew a long breath
      of relief and went up to the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long to pack his possessions. Now that there were no books
      to consider everything went into one old suit-case. And with this he set
      forth into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience had a gloomy thrill of its own. He had no notion where he
      was going. He hardly cared. The one great thing was to be going away&mdash;away
      from those rooms, from the trifling, irritating Hy, from the impossible
      Peter. He walked over to the bus station, set down his suit-case on the
      sidewalk, felt in his pockets to see if he had any money. He was always
      getting caught without it. He had given that taxi man an even bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently he was without it again. But in one pocket he found three keys
      that jingled together in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath; threw back his head and stared straight up through
      the trees at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the suit-case and marched off&mdash;a tall, thin, determined
      young man with an odd trick of throwing his right leg out and around as he
      walked and toeing in with the right foot&mdash;marched straight across
      town, under the Sixth Avenue Elevated, on into Greenwich Village; let
      himself into a rather dingy apartment building and then into a bare little
      three-rooms-and-bath from which not two hours back he had helped carry a
      big trunk, and dropped into the armchair in the living-room. And his hands
      shook with excitement as he lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a wild man!&rdquo; he informed himself&mdash;&ldquo;perfectly wild! It's not a
      bad thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slept, the last few hours of the night, on a bare mattress. But then a
      bachelor of a whimsical turn can make-shift now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this on the Saturday. On the Monday morning early, between eight and
      nine, there was giggling and fumbling at the apartment door, followed by a
      not over-resolute knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm&mdash;pipe in mouth, wearing his old striped pajamas caught
      across the chest with a safety-pin,&mdash;dropped his pen, snorted with
      impatience, and strode, heedless of self to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood an elated, abashed couple. Hy Lowe, still dapper, apparently
      very happy; Betty, glancing at him with an expression near timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; she murmured, taking in the somewhat unconventional
      figure before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Worm!&rdquo; chuckled Hy blithely. &ldquo;Why, you old devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Bates was looking impatiently from one to the other. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;what
      do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hy looked at Betty; Betty looked at Hy. She colored very prettily; he
      leaned against the wall and laughed softly there until his eyes filled,
      laughed himself weak. Finally he managed to observe to the irate figure on
      the sill, who held his pipe in a threatening attitude and awaited an
      explanation&mdash;&ldquo;My son, are you aware that the lady lives here? Also
      that you could hardly be termed overdressed.&rdquo; She spoke now, softly, with
      hesitation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Sue, Mr. Bates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his pipe. &ldquo;Gone&mdash;New Jersey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty seemed to recollect. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And wasn't there
      something&mdash;the other day, when was it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She exchanged a helplessly emotional glance with the partly sobered Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Saturday it must have been. Oh, of course, you wanted me to pack
      Sue's things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're packed,&rdquo; snapped the Worm. &ldquo;And gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, pray, are you doing here?&rdquo; This from Hy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living here,&rdquo; said the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the two sought each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really&mdash;&rdquo; Hy began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty rested her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Perhaps, Mr. Bates&mdash;you see, some
      of my things are here&mdash;some things I need&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Worm remembered. He blushed; then seemed to grow more angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better come in and get them,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if I might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came in. Betty repacked her bog in the bedroom. Once she called to
      Hy; they whispered; then he brought her his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Hy stood by the window and softly whistled a new rag. Meanwhile the
      Worm with a touch of self-consciousness, slipped on his coat. He had no
      bathrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy, still whistling, looked at the litter of closely written sheets on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;writing your novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; growled the Worm. He stared at the manuscript; then at Hy; then
      at the busy, beautiful, embarrassed young woman in the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly and savagely, he gathered up the papers, tore them down and
      across, handful by handful and stuffed them into the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy looked on in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was ready, and called to him. The Worm, set of face, showed them
      out. He did not know that he slammed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the steps Betty said&mdash;softly, the coo of a mating bird in her
      voice&mdash;&ldquo;What a funny man! I'm glad you're not like that, dear.&rdquo; And
      slipped her fingers into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hy returned her pressure; then withdrew his hand, glanced nervously up and
      down the street, and hurried her into the taxi that waited at the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One sure thing,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;we can't eat breakfast <i>there!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back in the rooms, the Worm&mdash;suddenly, feverishly, eager&mdash;laid
      out a fresh block of paper, dipped his pen into the ink, and snatching up
      a book for a ruler, drew a heavy line across near the top of the page.
      Above this line he printed out carefully&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE BOUNDARY

    <h3>
      A NOVEL
    </h3>

      &ldquo;They stood at the door...&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;EARTHY BROWNS AND GREENS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T about two
      o'clock in the afternoon on a Saturday in early September Sue Wilde opened
      a letter from the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dropping on the stiff walnut chair Sue had closed the door; ruffled
      by the feeling that it must be closed, conscious even of guilt. For it was
      a tenet of Aunt Matilda's, as of Mrs. Wilde's, that a woman should not sit
      down before mid-afternoon, and not then on Mondays, Wednesdays or
      Saturdays. And here her bed was not yet made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sue (so the letter ran)&mdash;Herewith my check for the September
      rent. Sorry to be late. I forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter sank to her lap. Pictures rose&mdash;memories. She saw the
      half-furnished little apartment on Tenth Street, in the heart of the old
      Village where she had spent the two busiest, most disturbing, yet&mdash;yes,
      happiest years of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a little news, some of which I can't tell you. Not until I know&mdash;which
      may be by the time this reaches you. In that case, if the news is anywhere
      near what I'm fool enough, every other minute, to hope, I shall doubtless
      be rushing post haste to see you and tell you how it all came about. I may
      reach you in person before this letter does. At present it is a new
      Treasure Island, a wildly adventurous comedy of life, with me for the hero&mdash;or
      the villain. That's what I'm waiting to be told. But it's rather
      miraculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was like Henry Bates to write mysteriously. He was excited; or he
      wouldn't be threatening to come out. It had been fine of him to keep from
      coming out. He hadn't forced her to ask it of him. She knew he wanted to.
      Now, at the thought that he almost certainly was coming, her pulse
      quickened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound in the hall, a cautious turning of the door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flushing, all nerves and self-consciousness, she leaped up, thrust the
      letter behind her, moved toward the bed that had not yet been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shyly smiling face of a nine-year-old girl appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it you, Miriam!&rdquo; breathed Sue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Becky. <i>If</i> we were to come in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along and shut the door after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children made for the closet where hung certain dancing costumes that
      had before this proved to hold a fascination bordering on the realm of
      magic. Sue resumed her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin is part of the news, Sue. He seems to have hit on prosperity. There
      are whispers that the great Silverstone has taken him up in earnest, sees
      in him the making of a big screen director. Z. himself told me the other
      night at the Parisian that he is going to put on a film production that
      will make <i>The Dawn of an Empire</i> and his own (and your) Nature look
      like the early efforts of an amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's still another piece of news I'm bursting with. I can't believe
      you don't know. But you haven't asked&mdash;haven't mentioned it in your
      letters. And Zanin told me he was wholly out of touch with you. It is hard
      to believe that you don't know it. For this bit of news is about you. The
      other that I spoke of first, is about me&mdash;a smaller matter. Lord, but
      you have buried yourself. Sue! You certainly went the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin, by the way, and that Belgian girl&mdash;Heléne something or other;
      you know, works in pastels, those zippy little character portraits, and
      dancing girls (didn't she do you, once?)&mdash;well, they're inseparable.
      It bothers me a little, seeing them always together at the Muscovy and the
      Parisian and Jim's. After all the stirring things you and he did together.
      She has spruced him up a lot, too. She's dressing him in color schemes&mdash;nice
      earthy browns and greens. Yes, J. Z. dresses amazingly well now. He has
      picked up a little money in these new business connections of his. But I
      resent the look of it&mdash;as if he had forgotten you. Though if he
      hadn't I should be crudely, horribly jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do come out I'll do my best to look respectable. Tell you what&mdash;I'll
      put on the good suit I had made especially to propose to you in. Remember?
      The time I lost my nerve and didn't say the words. Haven't worn it since,
      Sue. And the hat&mdash;shoes&mdash;cane. I'll wear 'em all! No one could
      be more chastely 'suburbaniacal' than Henry Bates will appear on this
      significant occasion. Even the forbidding aunt will feel a dawning respect
      for the erstwhile Worm&mdash;who was not a Worm, after all, but a
      chrysalis, now shortly to emerge a glittering, perfect creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not unkindly of your abandoned Villager,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the ending she chuckled aloud. The letter had carried her far from the
      plain room in a rather severe little house which in its turn conformed
      scrupulously in appearance to the uniformity that marked the double row of
      houses on this suburban street. They were all eyes, those houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to reconstruct a mental picture of that remarkable costume of
      the Worm's. But it was difficult to remember; she had seen it only the
      once, months ago, back in the spring. Would he look overdressed? That
      would be worse than if he were to wear the old bagging gray suit, soft
      collar and flowing tie&mdash;and the old felt hat. For the Street might
      think him one of her mysteriously theatrical acquaintances from the wicked
      city, in which event a new impetus would be given to the whispering that
      always ran subtly back and forth between the houses that were all eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was other chuckling in the room. The two children stood before her&mdash;Miriam,
      the elder, a big-eyed girl with a fluff of chestnut hair caught at the
      neck with a bow; Becky, small for her seven years, with tiny hands and
      feet and a demure mouth. Miriam had about head and shoulders the Spanish
      scarf that Sue had worn in Zanin's Carmen ballet at the Crossroads; Becky
      had thrust her feet into the red leather boots of Sue's Russian costume.
      When they found their half-sister's eye upon them the two giggled
      irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue felt a warm impulse to snatch them both up in her arms. But she
      sobered. This was old ground. Mrs. Wilde, as the wife and widow of an
      evangelical minister, felt strongly against dancing. Sue had promised to
      keep silent regarding this vital side of her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becky shuffled humorously to Sue's knee. Miriam came to her side, leaned
      against her shoulder, and gently, admiringly stroked her thick short hair,
      now grown to an unruly length but still short enough to disclose the fine
      outline of Sue's boyish yet girlish head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about the time you were a movie actress.&rdquo; This from Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue, dispirited, shook her head. &ldquo;You must take off those things,
      children., Put them back in the closet. Your mother wouldn't like it if
      she saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of obeying, Miriam leaned close to her ear and whispered: &ldquo;I've
      seen movies. Yesterday with the girls&mdash;after school. There was a wild
      west one, <i>Clarice of the Canyon</i>, and a comedy where he falls
      through the ceiling and all the plaster comes down on the bed and then the
      bed goes through another ceiling and all. It was awfully funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue mentally cast about her for guidance in the part she had promised to
      play. She deliberately frowned. &ldquo;Does your mother know about it, Miriam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl, bright-eyed, shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miriam still watched her, finally saying: &ldquo;Do you know why I told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue, feeling rather helpless, shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I knew you wouldn't tell on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue pursed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard a voice from the stair landing, Aunt Matilda's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue!&rdquo; it called&mdash;&ldquo;Sue! Some one to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm, surely! She sprang up, smoothed her shirt-waist before the
      mirror, tried to smooth her unmanageable hair. Her color was rising. She
      waited a moment to control this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue! Come down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her aunt on the stairs and was detained by a worn hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a man,&rdquo; whispered the older woman&mdash;&ldquo;one of those city friends
      cf yours, I take it. Looks like a Jew. Goodness knows what people will
      think! As if they didn't have enough to talk about already, without&mdash;this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue shook off her hand and ran down the stairs, oblivious now to her color
      as to the angry flash in her striking green eyes. It was Zanin, of course&mdash;-of
      all men! What if he had heard! In Greenwich Village there was none of the
      old vulgar race prejudice. Zarin was in certain respects the ablest man
      she had ever known. But there was no possibility that he could be
      understood, even tolerated, in this house on the Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him on the front porch where Aunt Matilda had left him. And for
      an instant, before extending her hand, she stared. For there stood the new
      Zanin&mdash;perceptibly fuller in face and figure, less wildly eager of
      eye, clad in the earthy brown suit that had so impressed the Worm, with a
      soft gray-green shirt that might have been flannel or silk or a mixture of
      the two, and a large bow tie and soft hat of a harmonious green-brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled easily, thoughtfully down at her as he took her hand. Then she
      felt him, more sober, more critical, studying her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sue,&rdquo; he observed&mdash;this was indeed a calm,
      successful-appearing Zanin&mdash;&ldquo;you're not looking so fit as you might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could say nothing to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dancing any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. None.&rdquo; She was wondering what to do with him. The choice appeared to
      lie between the stuffy parlor and this front porch. Within, the household
      would hear every word; out here the eyes of the Street would watch
      unrelentingly. With an impassive face and a little shrug, she remarked,
      indicating a stiff porch chair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take this,&rdquo; said he, dropping down on the top step in the most
      conspicuous spot of all. And he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't guess what brings me, Sue. First, I want you to run in town
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better. It's an unusual event. It wouldn't do to miss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes wandered toward the hall behind the screen door, then off to the
      row of wooden houses across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it's going to be missed, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He studied her. &ldquo;I'm debating with myself whether to tell you about it,
      Sue. Though it's a wonder you don't know. Haven't you followed the
      papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wondering, though,&rdquo; she observed: &ldquo;from the way you are talking, and
      from something Henry Bates said in a letter that came to-day&mdash;if it
      isn't the Nature film.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;First performance tonight. Really don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, our old friend Silverstone is in on it. He bought out the
      Interstellar interest. We're featuring it. At a two-dollar house, Sue&mdash;think
      of that! <i>The Dawn of an Empire</i> is nowhere. Unless it falls flat&mdash;which
      it won't!&mdash;there'll be a bit of money in it for all of us. What do
      you say now, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; mused Sue, incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular money&mdash;even for the small interest you and Peter and I hold.
      But that's only the beginning. Listen here now, Sue! A little time has
      gone by. You've hidden yourself out here&mdash;let your spirit sag&mdash;so
      I suppose you may find some difficulty in grasping this. But the Nature
      film is you, child. You're half famous already, thanks to the way we're
      letting loose on publicity. You're going to be a sensation&mdash;a
      knock-out&mdash;once the blessed public sees that film. Remember this:
      just because you decided to be another sort of person you haven't become
      that other person. Not for a minute! The big world is tearing right along
      at the old speed and you with it. With it? No&mdash;ahead of it! That's
      what our old <i>Nature</i>, that you worked so hard on, is doing for you
      right now. Can you grasp that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said she listlessly, &ldquo;I grasp it all right. But you're wrong in
      saying it is me. I am another person. Jacob&mdash;I couldn't go to see
      that film.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Her lips were compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sue&mdash;that's outrageous! It's fanatical!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is. I can't help it,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the frankness&mdash;the costuming&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her hands over her eyes. &ldquo;And people from here will be
      slipping in to see it&mdash;sneaking in when they think their neighbors
      won't see them&mdash;and seeing me on exhibition there! And they will
      whisper. Oh, the vulgarity of it!... Jacob, don't talk about it. I can't!
      Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He studied her, through narrowed eyes. &ldquo;The poor kid <i>is</i> going
      through it!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I had no idea!&rdquo; Deliberately, with the coldness,
      the detachment, of his race, he considered the problem. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you my main errand, Sue. I've got an enormous new production
      on. It's in my hands, too, as director. Silverstone gives me carte blanche&mdash;that's
      his way. Big man. Now I've got an eye in my head. I've seen our <i>Nature</i>
      run off. And I happen to know that the big movie star of to-morrow, the
      sensation of them all, is Miss Sue Wilde. You don't realize that, of
      course. All right! Don't try to. But do try to get <i>this</i>. I want you
      for my new production. And I can offer you more money than you ever saw in
      all your life. Not two thousand a week, like Mabel Wakeford, but a lot.
      And still you'll be cheaper to my company than women not half so good who
      have built up a market value in the film business. It will be a bargain
      for us. I brought out a contract ready for you to sign. Salary begins
      to-morrow if you say the word. Would you like to read it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were still over her eyes. She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of pressing his business he went on quietly studying her. He
      studied the house, too; and the street. After a time he consulted a
      time-table and his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he said then, &ldquo;I'm disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Jacob.&rdquo; She looked up now and threw out her hands. &ldquo;But you
      couldn't understand. I couldn't look at that film, at myself doing those
      things. It's a thing that's&mdash;well, Jacob, it is repellent to me now.
      It's a thing I wish I hadn't done. I thought I believed it&mdash;your
      theory of freedom, naturalness, all that. I don't believe it. But all the
      same I'm on record there. The most conspicuous girl in the United States&mdash;from
      what you say&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily that, Sue. By to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;picturing a philosophy I don't believe in. I've been daring almost
      to forget it. Now you're bringing it home to me. It is branded on me now.
      God knows what it is going to mean! Of course it will follow me into my
      home here. And you know what people will think and say&mdash;these,
      people&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the orderly street with a sweep of a fine arm
      and hand&mdash;&ldquo;they'll think and talk of me as a girl who has done what
      no decent girl can do and stay decent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, choking. He was still coolly observing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;I'm disappointed. I'm afraid it's just as well for
      you to give up. You've lost something, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose. And she let him go in silence; stood looking after him until he
      disappeared around the corner. Then she went up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were still there, serenely happy in unheard-of mischief. They
      had all her dancing clothes spread out on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door. The girls giggled nervously; she hardly saw them. She
      lifted up the Russian costume and fingered the bright-colored silk. Dreams
      came to her mind's eye. She looked at the little boots of red leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please dance for us,&rdquo; begged Miriam shyly, at her side. She hardly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the side of the room, then leaped out in that bounding,
      crouching Russian step. She was stiff, awkward. She stepped back and tried
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children laughed in sheer excitement and clapped their hands. Becky
      tried to imitate the step, fell over and rolled, convulsed with laughter,
      on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Mrs. Wilde stood on the threshold. She was a tall thin
      woman, all in black, with a heavy humorless mouth, pallid skin, flat
      pouches under her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam! Becky!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come here instantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Becky got up. The two children, crestfallen, between sulkiness and a
      measure of fear, moved slowly toward the door. The mother stood aside,
      ushered them out, then confronted the younger woman. There was a tired
      sort of anger in her eyes. The almost impenetrable egotism of her
      widowhood had been touched and stirred by the merry little scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold your promises lightly,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue bit her lip, threw out her hands. &ldquo;It isn't that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; Mrs. Wilde moved into the room and closed the door. &ldquo;I
      don't quite see what we are to do, Sue. I can't have this sort of
      temptation put before them right here, in their home. You know what I have
      taught them and what I expect of them. You know' I wish to be kind to you,
      but this isn't fair. He&mdash;he...&rdquo; She carried a handkerchief, heavily
      bordered with black. This she pressed to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hot temper blazed in Sue. She struggled with it. Sharp words rushed to
      her tongue. She drove them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to her that she must be considerate; the woman's life had been
      torn from its roots, what mind she had was of course overwhelmed. Sue
      stood there, her hands clenched at her sides, groping desperately for some
      point of mental contact with the woman who had married her father&mdash;forgetting
      that there had never been a print of mental contact. Suddenly she recalled
      a few hot phrases of the Worm's, spoken in regard to this very matter of
      her attempt to confine her life within this gloomy home&mdash;&ldquo;It's
      Puritan against Cavalier&mdash;both right, both wrong! It's the Greeks
      against the Greatest of Jews&mdash;both right, both wrong! Beauty against
      duty, the instinct to express against the instinct to serve&mdash;both
      right, both wrong!&rdquo;... Was Henry Bates right? Was the gulf between her
      natural self and this home unbridgeable? Motionless, tense, she tried, all
      in an instant, to think this through&mdash;and failed. A wave of emotion
      overwhelmed her, an uprushing of egotism as blind as the egotism of the
      woman in black who stood stiffly against the closed door. It was a clash&mdash;not
      of wills, for Sue's will was to serve&mdash;but of natures.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;ONE DOES FORGET ABOUT HAPPINESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UE felt that the
      woman was about to speak, and suddenly she knew that she could not listen.
      Fighting down the rather terrifying force of her emotions, fighting tears
      even, she rushed to the door, mutely brushed Mrs. Wilde aside and ran down
      the stairs. Sue let herself out on the front porch, closed the screen door
      and leaned hack against it, clinging to the knob, breathless, unstrung.
      The eyes of the Street would be on her, of course. She thought of this and
      dropped into one of the porch chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man turned the corner&mdash;a tall, rather young man who wore a
      shapeless suit of gray, a limp collar, a flowing bow tie, a soft hat; and
      who had a trick of throwing his leg out and around as he walked and toeing
      in with the right font.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned in, grinning cheerfully and waving a lean hand. He mounted the
      steps. Sue sat erect, gripping the arms of her chair, eyes bright, and
      laughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she cred, &ldquo;you're hopeless! Where's the new suit? You're not a
      bit respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself on the porch railing and gazed ruefully downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue, I'm sorry. Plum forgot. And I swore I'd never disgrace you again. I
      <i>am</i> hopeless. You're right.&rdquo; Then he laughed&mdash;irresponsibly,
      happily, like a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him. &ldquo;What is it, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, child! You see before you the man who has just conquered the
      world. All of it. And no worlds left. Mr. Alexander H. Bates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, thinking swiftly back&mdash;&ldquo;your novel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. My novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't finished, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite half done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, how can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised a long hand and rose. He gazed down benignly at her. &ldquo;The
      greatest publisher in these U. S. has had the good fortune to read the
      first fourteen chapters. A whisper blew to me yesterday of the way things
      were going&mdash;before I wrote you. But the word this morning was not a
      whisper. Susan. It was an ear-splitting yell. Mister Greatest Publisher
      personally sent for me. Told me he had been looking for me&mdash;exactly
      me!&mdash;these twenty-eight years. And here I am. Money now if I need it.
      And do I need it? God, do I need it! And fame later&mdash;when I get the
      book done. Now, child, tell me how glad you are. At once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked the porch; came back and stood before her; grinned and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not find words. Soberly her eyes followed him. Her set mouth
      softened. Her tightened muscles relaxed until she was leaning back limp in
      the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it the devil, Sue!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The one thing my heart was set on was
      to wear that good suit. Sue, I was going to put it all over this suburb of
      yours&mdash;just smear 'em! And look&mdash;I have to go and forget.
      Nothing comes out to see you but the same disgraceful old gipsy. How could
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue leaned forward. &ldquo;Henry, I'm glad. I love this old suit. But there's a
      button coming loose&mdash;there, on your coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Sue. I sewed at it, but it doesn't hold. I'm meaning to stop at a
      tailor's, next time I'm over toward Sixth Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was studying his face now. &ldquo;You're happy, Henry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;in a sense! In a sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good thing you came. I was forgetting about happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. One does.&rdquo; He consulted his watch. &ldquo;It's five-twenty-two now,
      Sue. And we're catching the five-thirty-eight back to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. But her eyes met his, squarely; held to them. It was a
      forthright eye-to-eye gaze, of the sort that rarely occurs, even between
      friends, and that is not soon forgotten. Sue had been white, sitting
      there, when he came and after. Now her color returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over and took her elbow. The touch of his hand was a luxury. Her
      lids drooped; her color rose and rose. She let him almost lift her from
      the chair. Then she went in for her hat and coat; still silent. They
      caught the five-thirty-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going in for?&rdquo; she asked, listless again, when they had found
      a seat in the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! You know! To see the almost famous Sue Wilde of Greenwich
      Village&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of the Village now, Henry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;in the film sensation of the decade. <i>Nature</i>, suggested and
      directed by Jacob Zanin, written by Eric Mann, presented by the Nature
      Film Producing Company, Adolph Silverstone, President. You see, I've been
      getting you up, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was staring cut the window gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swore I wouldn't go, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that would be a shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;of course. But&mdash;Henry, you don't understand. Nobody
      understands! I'm not sure I can stand it to sit there and see myself doing
      those things&mdash;and have to talk with people I know, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could smuggle you in,&rdquo; said he, thoughtful. &ldquo;This isn't a
      little movie house, you know. It's a regular theater. There ought to be a
      separate gallery entrance. That would make it easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She changed the subject. &ldquo;Where shall we eat, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Parisian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Let's go to Jim's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Jim's they went; and it seemed to him whimsically watchful eyes that
      she had an occasional moment of being her old girlish self as they
      strolled through the wandering streets of Greenwich Village and stepped
      down into the basement oyster and chop house that had made its name a full
      generation before Socialism was more than a foreign-sounding word and two
      generations before cubism, futurism, vorticism, imagism, Nietzsche, the I.
      W. W., Feminism and the Russians had swept in among the old houses and
      tenements to engage in the verbal battle royal that has since converted
      the quaint old quarter from a haunt of rather gently artistic bohemianism
      into a shambles of dead and dismembered and bleeding theories. Jim's alone
      had not changed. Even the old waiter who so far as any one knew had always
      been there, shuffled through the sprinkling of sawdust on the floor; and
      the familiar fat grandson of the original Jim was still to be seen
      standing by the open grill that was set in the wall at the rear end of the
      oyster bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm suggested thick mutton chops and the hugely delectable baked
      potatoes without which Jim's would not have been Jim's. Sue smiled rather
      wanly and assented. Her air of depression disturbed him; his own buoyancy
      sagged; he found it necessary now and then to manufacture talk. This was
      so foreign to the quality of their friendship that he finally laid down
      his knife and fork, rested his elbows on the table and considered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;it's getting to you, isn't it&mdash;the old Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to smile, and looked off toward the glowing grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you come around and have a look at the rooms? I haven't changed
      them. Only your pictures are gone. Even your books are on the mantel where
      you used to keep them. It might hook things up for us, so we could get to
      feeling and talking like ourselves. What do you say&mdash;could you stand
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to look at him, tried to be her old frank self; but without
      marked success. The tears were close. She had to compress her lips and
      study the table-cloth for a long moment before she could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't, Henry.&rdquo; Then with an impulse that was more like the Sue that
      he knew, she reached out and rested her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Try not to mind
      me, Henry. I can't help it&mdash;whatever it is. I don't seem to have much
      fight left in me. It's plain enough that I shouldn't have tried to come
      in. It was just a crazy reaction, anyway. You caught me when I had been
      hurt. I was all mixed....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was excluding him from her little world now; and this was least like
      her of all the things she had been saying and doing. But if the Worm was
      hurt he did not show it. He merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue, of course, you've been going through a nervous crisis, and it has
      taken a lot out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot, Henry,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing strikes me&mdash;superficial, of course&mdash;I doubt if you've
      had enough exercise this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;To-day I tried a few steps&mdash;that&mdash;old
      Russian dance, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd love to see you do it, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I've lost it&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were stiff, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was painful. I just couldn't dance. I don't like to think of it,
      Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;One thing&mdash;I've decided to make you walk to the theater.
      It's two miles. That'll stir your pulse a bit. And we'll start now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked soberly at him. &ldquo;You've lost nothing, Henry. The work you've
      done hasn't taken it out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a hit. On the contrary, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of the old aimlessness, Susan. No more books&mdash;except a look
      at yours now and then, because they were yours. God, girl, I'm creating!
      I'm living! I'm saying something. And I really seem to have it to say.
      That's what stirs you, puts a tingle into your blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She studied him a moment longer, then lowered her eyes. &ldquo;Let's be
      starting,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up Fifth Avenue, Sue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Henry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked eastward on Waverly Place, across Sixth Avenue. She paused
      here and looked up almost fondly at the ugly, shadowy elevated structure
      in the twilight. A train roared by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen the city for two months,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a long time&mdash;-for a live person,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dusty foliage of Washington Square appeared ahead. Above it like a
      ghost of the historic beauty of the old Square, loomed the marble arch.
      The lights of early evening twinkled from street poles and shone warmly
      from windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned up the Avenue whose history is the history of a century of New
      York life. Through the wide canyon darted the taxis and limousines that
      marked the beginnings of the city's night activity. The walks were
      thronged with late workers hurrying to their homes in the tenements to the
      south and west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parisian restaurant was bright with silver, linen and electric lights
      behind the long French windows. He caught Sue giving the old place a
      sober, almost wistful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Fourteenth Street they encountered the ebb of the turbid human tide
      that at nightfall flows east and west across the great Avenue and picked
      their way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above Fourteenth Street they entered the deep dim canyon of loft
      buildings. The sweatshops were here from which every noon and every night
      poured forth the thousands upon thousands of toilers&mdash;underfed,
      undersized, prominent of nose, cheek-bones and lips, gesticulating,
      spreading and shambling of gait, filling the great Avenue with a low roar
      of voluble talk in a strange guttural tongue&mdash;crowding so densely
      that a chance pedestrian could no more than drift with the slow current.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nightly torrent was well over when Sue and the Worm walked through the
      blighted district, but each was familiar with the problem; each had played
      some small part in the strikes that stirred the region at intervals. Sue
      indeed pointed out the spot, just below Twenty-third Street where she had
      been arrested for picketing. And the Worm noted that she had steadied
      perceptibly as the old associations bit by bit reasserted their claims on
      her life. She was chatting with him now, nearly in the old, easy,
      forthright way. By the time the huge white facade of the Public Library
      came into view, with its steps, terraces, railings and misty trees, and
      the crosstown cars were clanging by just ahead at Forty-second Street, and
      they were meeting an occasional bachelor diner-out hurrying past in
      dinner-coat and straw hat, the Worm found himself chuckling again. They
      turned west on Forty-second Street, crossing Sixth Avenue, Broadway and
      Seventh Avenue, passing the glittering hotel on a famous corner and
      heading for the riotously whirling, darting, blazing devices in colored
      light by means of which each theater of the congested group sought to
      thrust itself most violently upon the bewildered optic nerves of the
      passer-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite one of these the Worm took Sue's arm, very gently, and halted her
      on the curb. The evening throng brushed past, heedless of the simply
      dressed girl who yet was oddly, boyishly slim and graceful of body, and
      who was striking of countenance despite the weariness evident about the
      rather strongly modeled mouth and the large, thoughtful green eyes;
      heedless, as well, of the lank, shabbily dressed young man who held her
      arm and bent earnestly over her. They were atoms in the careering
      metropolis, uncounted polyps in the blind, swarming, infinitely laborious
      structure that is New York. And they thought themselves, each, the center
      of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue, dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here we are. You're about to see yourself. It will
      be an experience. And it won't be what you're thinking and&mdash;yes,
      dreading. I've seen it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night&mdash;an exhibition to the newspaper men.&rdquo; The emotion in his
      voice was evident. She glanced up again, something puzzled. &ldquo;It was last
      night&mdash;afterward&mdash;that I decided on bringing you in. I wouldn't
      for anything in the world have missed having you here to-night. Though, at
      that, if Mr. Greatest Publisher hadn't warmed my soul with that wonderful
      blast of hot air I probably shouldn't have had the nerve. Of course I knew
      it would be an ordeal. It's been on my conscience every minute. But I had
      to bring you, and I believe you'll understand why, two hours from now. I'm
      hoping you will, Sue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. She waited. Suddenly then, he hurried her across the busy
      street and into the dim shelter of the gallery entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanin was out in front,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;With some of the newspaper boys, but I
      got you by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many individuals and groups were detaching themselves from the endless
      human stream and turning in between the six-foot lithographs at the main
      entrance to the theater. More and more steadily as Sue and the Worm stood
      in the shadow of the lesser doorway they had chosen, the crowds poured in.
      Others were turning in here toward the gallery and tramping up the long
      twisting stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big house!&rdquo; chuckled the Worm. &ldquo;Oh, they'll put it across, Sue. You wait!
      Zanin's publicity has been wonderful. It would have disturbed you, girl&mdash;but
      it's rather a shame you haven't followed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue seemed not to hear him. She was leaning out from the doorway, trying
      to make out the subjects of the two big lithographs. She finally slipped
      across to the curb and studied them a moment. Both were of herself,
      half-clad in the simple garment of an island savage; over each picture was
      the one word, &ldquo;NATURE,&rdquo; under each the two words, &ldquo;SUE WILDE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried back and started up the stairs. The Worm saw that she was
      flushing again and that her mouth wore the set look.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a landing, holding her back from a group ahead, he said: &ldquo;Do you know,
      Sue, part of the disturbance you feel is just a shrinking from
      conspicuousness, from the effective thing. Self-consciousness! Isn't it,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she turned away and kept on.

      CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;THE NATURE FILM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T that time no
      moving picture had been given the setting that Jacob Zanin devised for the
      Nature film. Zanin had altered the interior of the building to make it as
      little as possible like the conventional theater. Only the walls,
      galleries and boxes and stage remained as they had been. The new
      decorations were in the pale greens and pinks of spring and were simple.
      Between foyer and auditorium were palms, with orchids and other tropical
      flowers. The orchestra was not in sight. The ushers were calm girls from
      the Village&mdash;students of painting, designing, writing, sculpture&mdash;dressed
      modestly enough in a completer drapery of the sort worn by Sue in the
      pictures, such a material as Philippine women weave from grasses and
      pineapple strands, softly buff and cream and brown in color, embroidered
      with exquisite skill in exotic designs. The stage before the screen (Zanin
      used no drop curtain) represented a native village on some imaginary South
      Sea Island. The natives themselves were there, quietly moving about the
      routine of their lives or sitting by a low fire before the group of huts
      at one side of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very likely you saw it. If so, you will understand the difficulty I am
      confronted with in describing the place. It made a small sensation, the
      theater itself, apart from the Nature film. But a penned description could
      not convey the freshness, the quiet charm, the dignity of that interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dignity was what first touched Sue. The Worm watched her sidelong as
      her eyes roved from the flat surfaces of pure bold color on the walls to
      the quietly idyllic scene on the stage that managed to look as if it were
      not a stage. She exhibited little emotion at first. Her brow was slightly
      furrowed, the eyes thoughtful, the mouth set&mdash;that was all. She had
      gone through the difficult months of enacting the film at first with
      enthusiasm, later doggedly. She had early lost her vision of the thing as
      a whole; her recollections now were of doing over and over this bit and
      that, of a certain youthful actor who had taken it for granted that a girl
      who would dress as she had to dress the character could be casually made
      love to, of interminable train rides to the outdoor &ldquo;locations,&rdquo; of
      clashes of will between Zanin and the Interstellar people&mdash;of work,
      quarrels, dust, money and the lack of it and a cumulative disillusionment.
      It came to her now that she had lost that early vision. More, she had
      forgotten the sincerity and the purpose of Jacob Zanin, that beneath his
      cold Jewish detachment he believed this thing&mdash;that the individual
      must be freed from conformity and (as he saw it) its attendant hypocrisy
      by breaking the yoke of the home. It must be the individual&mdash;first,
      last, always&mdash;-the glad, free individual&mdash;the will to live, to
      feel, to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Village jargon, done into something near a masterpiece. Sue
      began to see as the film unrolled before her eyes, reel by reel, that
      Zanin had never for a moment lost his dream. Even now, merely sitting in
      that steep crowded gallery waiting for the first reel of the ten, Sue knew
      that he had never lost it. Nor had Peter. The thought was exciting. It
      brought the color back to her cheeks. Her lips parted slightly. She was
      feeling again the enthusiasm Peter's scenario had roused in her at the
      start, but with a new intensity. The Worm, at her side, watching every
      slight subtle change of that young face, forgot his own stirring news of
      the morning, forgot that he was Alexander H. Bates, and the expression of
      a man who had bcen long hungry crept into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nature film, you recall, pictured an imaginary people, simple, even
      primitive, untouched by what men call civilisation. To their secluded
      island comes the ship of an explorer, suggesting by its outlines and
      rigging and the costumes of officers and crew, the brave days of Captain
      Cook, or perhaps a period half a century earlier. The indefiniteness of it
      was baffling and fascinating. At no point did it date! And the island was
      not one of those that dot the South Seas, at least the inhabitants were
      not savages. They were intelligent, industrious, gentle. But the women
      hunted and fished with the men. Love&mdash;or passion, at least&mdash;was
      recognized for the impermanent gust it so often is&mdash;and, as such, was
      respected. No woman dreamed of tying herself for life to a lover she no
      longer loved. Neither want nor respectability could lower her pride to
      that point. Fatherhood, apparently, was not fixed, a hint being conveyed
      that the men as a group were bound to contribute to the welfare of young
      mothers. Thus the men were perhaps less glad and free than the women;
      indeed there was more than a suggestion of matriarchy.... To this
      community, thrown by an accident on its shores, the hundred odd men from
      the ship brought a habit of discipline, a holy book (that was and was not
      the Bible), a rigid marriage law, a complete hard theory of morality with
      attached penalties, plenty of firearms, hogshead upon hogshead of strong
      liquor, and underlying everything else an aggressive acquisitiveness that
      showed itself in the beginning as the trading instinct and later, of
      course, became politics and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some measure it was the old obvious outcry against the conquest of weak
      and simple peoples. Or the situation at the start indicated something of
      the sort. But the story that grew out of the situation was less obvious.
      Indeed, developed by Peter, with his theatrical skill, out of Zanin's raw
      anarchism, it was a drama of quality and power. Zanin had been able to
      make nothing more out of it than a clash of social theories. Peter had
      made it a clash of persons; and through the deliberate development of this
      clash ran, steadily increasing in poignancy and tragic force straight to
      the climax of assassination, the story of a girl. Peter himself did not
      know how good it was. Not until he read about it in the papers (after
      which he became rather irritatingly complacent regarding it). For you will
      remember, Peter was crazily pursuing that girl when he wrote it. And the
      girl was boldly, wonderfully Sue&mdash;a level-eyed, outspoken young
      woman, confronting life; ashamed of nothing, not her body, not her soul;
      dreaming beautifully of freedom, of expressing herself, of living her
      life, vibrant with health, courage, joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, you know, fell in love with a young sailor and gave herself
      proudly and freely. The sailor could not comprehend her, became furtive
      and jealous. They quarreled. To quiet her he was driven to brutality. For
      he was a respectable man and held his reputation high. The affair became
      known. The men of the ship, muttering strange words about a custom called
      marriage, held her as bad, fell on the age-old decision that she must
      continue to be, bad, at their call, though furtively. For they were all
      respectable men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we saw the girl as an outcast, fed, for a time, secretly by the cowed
      bewildered tribe. We saw her as a dishonored mother, fighting the sea, the
      forest, the very air for sustenance. We caught glimpses of the new
      community, growing into a settlement of some stability, the native men
      forced into the less wholesome labor, then wives and daughters taken and
      poisoned with this strange philosophy of life. Then we saw our girl, her
      child toddling at her heels, creeping back into the society where trade
      and politics, hard liquor (distilled now from the native grain), that holy
      book of mysterious spell, the firearms and an impenetrable respectability
      reigned in apparent security over smoldering fires. And finally we saw the
      girl, not at all a penitent, but a proud inspired creature of instinct,
      fan those fires until they purged the taint of sophistication from each
      slumbering native soul and drove a half-mad people at the desperate job of
      extermination and of reasserting itself as a people on the old lawlessly
      happy footing. They burned the hogsheads of liquor, the firearms, the heap
      of holy books, on one great bonfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not doing it justice. But this much will serve to recall the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Zanin's propaganda, I doubt if it cut in very deeply. Critics and
      public alike appeared to take it simply as a novelty, a fresh sensation as
      they had taken Reinhardt and the Russian Ballet. The primitiveness of it
      reached them no more clearly than the primitiveness of Wagner's operas
      reached them. The clergy stormed a bit, of course; but not because they
      comprehended the deeply implied anarchistic motive. They were concerned
      over Zanin's rather unbending attitude toward a certain book. And Zanin;
      delighted, fed columns of controversy to the afternoon papers, wrote open
      letters to eminent divines, and in other ways turned the protest into a
      huge success of publicity. Then a professional objector, apparently
      ignorant of the existence of an enticing and corrupting &ldquo;Revue&rdquo; across the
      street, haled Zanin, Silverstone and two of the Interstellar people into
      court on the ground that the costuming was improper. This matter Zanin,
      after the newspapers had done it full justice, compromised by cutting out
      twenty-two feet of pictures and one printed explanation which seemed to
      the professional objector to justify child-birth out of wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, beyond these brief attacks of virtue, I have never been able to see
      that the great city did not pulse along about as before. Broadway and
      Forty-second Street held their usual evening throngs. The saloons and
      hotel bars took in fortunes from the flushed, sometimes furtive men that
      poured out between the acts of that &ldquo;Revue.&rdquo; Gamblers gambled, robbers
      robbed; the glittering hotels thrived; men bought and sold and centered on
      the ugly business of politics and bargained with the nameless girls that
      lurked in shadowy doorways&mdash;but furtively, of course, with an eye to
      respectability. And in parsonages on side streets clergymen studied the
      precise attitude of Paul toward the doctrine of Free Will or wrote (for
      Sunday evening) of the beautiful day that was close at hand when all men
      should sing in harmony and not discord, with harp accompaniment.... No, I
      think, despite Zanin's purpose, despite Sue's blazing faith, what really
      triumphed was Peter Mann's instinct for a good story. It was the story
      that held them, and the real beauty of the pictures, and the acting and
      personal charm and sincerity of Sue Wilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, or something, held Sue herself. For it did catch her. She had
      thought she knew everything about the Nature film; whereas she knew
      everything about it but the Nature film. At first, naturally, her
      self-consciousness clung a little; then it fell away. She sat with an
      elbow on the arm of the seat, chin on hand, never once taking her eyes
      from the screen, hardly aware of the dense audience about her, no more
      than barely hearing the skilfully selected Russian music of the hidden,
      very competent orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two intermissions. During the first she tried to chat and
      failed. In the second, when the Worm suggested a turn in the open air she
      merely shook her head, without looking up. And that hungry look deepened
      in the Worm's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end, when the buffeted but unbowed young woman was fighting
      with the strength of inspired despair for the one decent hope left to her,
      the hope of personal freedom, Peter's story reached its highest point. As
      did Sue's acting. The girl herself, sitting up there in the gallery, head
      bowed, shading with a slim hand her wet eyes, leaned more and more closely
      against the dear whimsical friend at her side. When his groping hand found
      hers she clung to it as honestly as the girl on the screen would have
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over. For a moment the house was in darkness and silence. This was
      another of Zanin's effects. Then the lights came on dimly; the concealed
      orchestra struck softly into another of those Russian things; the
      primitive people on the stage, you suddenly saw, were quietly going on
      about the simple business of their village. A girl like Sue walked on,
      skilfully picked out by the lighting. The audience caught the suggestion
      and turned where they stood in seat-rows, aisles and entrances to applaud
      wildly. Still another Zaninesque touch!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>LOWLY the crowd in
      the gallery moved out and down the twisting flights of stairs. Sue slipped
      her arm through the Worm's and silently clung to him. They were very close
      in spirit. Down at the street entrance, she said, &ldquo;I don't want to see
      anybody, Henry.&rdquo; So he hurried her across the street through a lane in the
      after-theater traffic and around the corner into Seventh Avenue, heading
      south.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have a bite somewhere, Sue,&rdquo; said he then, Her head inclined in
      assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere up around here and not on Broadway. Where we won't see a Soul.&rdquo;
       Her arm was still in his. She felt him draw a sudden deep breath. &ldquo;Oh, Sue&mdash;if
      only I could take you down to the old rooms&mdash;make a cup of coffee&mdash;sit
      and look at you curled up in your own big chair&mdash;&rdquo; He broke OFF. Sue,
      still half in a dream, considered this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know, Henry&mdash;If you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arm now pressed hers so tightly against his side that it hurt her a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said in a low rough voice. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see what's the matter, girl? I couldn't do it. I'd never let
      you go&mdash;never! I'm insane with love for you. I'm full of you&mdash;throbbing,
      singing, thrilling with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he stopped short They walked on slowly, arm in arm. She glanced up
      at his face. It was twisted, as with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to think. Every way lay confusion. Suddenly she freed her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry&mdash;&rdquo; she began; then walked on a dozen steps before she could
      continue. &ldquo;You have a timetable, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Sue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Henry! I can't miss that late train. I have no key, as it is, It
      will be difficult enough.&rdquo; They walked another block, moving steadily
      toward the Pennsylvania-Station-Herald-Square region whence all roads lead
      out into Long Island and New Jersey. She did not know what he would say or
      do. It was a relief when finally he found the time-table in his pocket and
      handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood under a street light to puzzle out the cabalistic tangle of fine
      print.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it now, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his watch for her to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can make it. I hate the tube, but there isn't time now for the
      ferry. Come as far as Herald Square with me, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There at the stairway under the elevated road she gripped his hand for an
      instant, then ran lightly down into the underground station. And not until
      the smoky local train, over in Jersey, was half-way out to the village
      that she now called home did it come to her that he had spoken not one
      word after the little episode of the time-table. She could see his face,
      too, with that look of pain on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang and rang at the door. Finally she knocked. Aunt Matilda came
      then, silent, grim, and let her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her room was as she had left it when she rushed out in the afternoon. The
      dancing clothes lay on the bed. Rather feverishly she threw them on a
      chair. The Russian costume fell to the floor. She let it lie there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept little; but, wide-eyed, all tight nerves, lay late. She heard
      them go off to Sunday-school, at quarter past nine. The children would be
      back at eleven; but Mrs. Wilde and Aunt Matilda, if they followed their
      custom, would stay on to church. That is, unless Mrs. Wilde should have
      one of her nervous headaches. Sue hoped they would stay. It seemed to her
      that by noon she should be able to get herself in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay a while longer. Then went down-stairs in her kimono and warmed up
      the coffee Aunt Matilda had left on the stove. She tried to eat a little
      bread, but had to give it up. She began to wonder, a thought frightened
      now, if she could get herself in hand by noon. Aunt Matilda's appearance,
      when she came in, had been forbidding. This morning no one had come near
      her, not even the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she mounted the stairs. Aimlessly she began dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian costume on the floor held her eye. She picked it up, lingered
      it. Then she put it on. One of the red boots was on the chair, the other
      under the bed. She found this and drew them both on. Next she got the gay
      cap from the closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before the mirror. It seemed to her that her color was slowly
      returning. She slapped her cheeks to hasten it. Her thoughts were in a
      strange confusion. Just as she had been doing all night, she tried again
      to visualize her memories of those hard busy days of working out the
      Nature film, tried to build out of what she could faintly, brokenly piece
      together the picture as she had now seen it, a complete created thing. But
      it was a jumble; it always went back to a bit of this experience and a bit
      of that. She tried to believe that the stirring, confident, splendid young
      creature on the screen was herself.... She pressed her palms against her
      temples. She could have cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief to fall into one, then another of the old exercises
      preliminary to the dance. She went at these hard, until she could feel the
      warm blood tingling in her finger tips. Then she tried out that difficult
      Russian step. It did not come easily. There was effort in it. And her
      balance was not good. Then, too, the room was too small.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's hesitation she ran down-stairs, shut herself into the
      parlor, moved the furniture back against the walls, went methodically to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, a little later, the human materials for a romantic comedy were
      swiftly converging on her She did not know it. She did not once glance out
      the window. She heard nothing but the patter of her own light steps, the
      rustle of her silken costume, the clinking of the metals in the heels of
      the red boots that was meant to suggest the jingle of spurs.

      Mrs. Wilde did have one of her headaches. She came home from Sunday-school
      with the children, leaving Aunt Matilda to uphold the good name of the
      household by remaining alone for church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tall woman and the two little girls&mdash;the girls demure, the
      woman gloomy in her depth of sorrow&mdash;turned in at the front walk, a
      tall young man, in a baggy old gray suit, with a trick of throwing his
      right leg out and around as he walked and toeing in with the right foot,
      was rounding the corner, rushing along with great strides. His brow was
      knit, his manner distrait but determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlor door opened. Mrs. Wilde stood there, speechless. The girls
      crowded forward, incredulous, eager, their eyes alight. Becky jumped up
      and down and clapped her small hands. Mrs. Wilde suppressed her with a
      slap. The child began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue stood in the middle of the room, flushed, excited, a glowing picture
      from a Bakst album.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilde, bewildered, struggling for speech, gazed at the outraged
      furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue, catching a new sound, stared past her at a lanky figure of a man who
      stood at the screen door. Then with a sudden little cry, she rushed out to
      him. He opened the door and stepped within. Her arms flew around his neck.
      His arms held her close. He lifted her chin with a reverent hand, and
      kissed her lips. He did not know there was another person in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilde swept the children into a corner where they might not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Are you crazy? Have you no sense&mdash;no shame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue threw hack her head, choked down a sound that might have been a laugh
      or a sob. Her eyes were radiant. &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;None!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII&mdash;REENTER MARIA TONIFETTI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was the opening
      of Peter Ericson (&ldquo;Eric&rdquo;,) Mann's new play, <i>The Truffler</i>, at the
      Astoria Theater on Broadway where the signs never fail and where to have
      your name blazoned in electric lights above a theater entrance is to be
      advertised to a restless but numerically impressive world. Peter's name
      was up there now. It was, you might have supposed, his big night. But
      Peter was not among the eight or nine hundred correctly dressed men and
      women that pressed in expectantly through the wide doorway. Instead, clad
      in his every-day garments, an expression of ill-controlled irritation on
      his lung face, moody dark eyes peering resentfully out through his large
      horn-rimmed glasses, he sat alone in the gallery, second row from the
      front, on the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four rows behind him and a little off to the left, sat a good-looking
      young woman, an Italian girl apparently, who stared down at him in some
      agitation. She, too, was alone. He had not seen her when he came in; he
      did not know that she was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two seats in the front row across the aisle were vacant until just
      before the musicians climbed from the mysterious region beneath the stage
      into the orchestra pit down front and the asbestos curtain slid upward and
      out of sight. Then a rather casually dressed young couple came down the
      aisle and took them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, when he saw who they were, stiffened, bit his lip, turned away and
      partly hid his face with his program. The girl was Sue Wilde, the one
      person on earth who had the power of at once rousing and irritating him
      merely by appearing within his range of vision. Particularly when she
      appeared smiling, alert and alive with health and spirit, in the company
      of another man. When a girl has played with your deepest feelings, has
      actually engaged herself to marry you, only to slip out of your life
      without so much as consulting you, when she has forced you to take stern
      measures to bring her to her senses&mdash;only to turn up, after all,
      radiant, just where you have stolen to be alone with your otherwise
      turbulent emotions&mdash;well, it may easily be disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man, on this occasion, was the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter knew that the Worm, like Hy, had disapproved of the steps he had
      taken to waken the truffling Sue to a sense of duty, the steps he had been
      forced to take. It is not pleasant to be disapproved of by old companions;
      particularly when you were so clearly, scrupulously right in all you have
      done. Still more unpleasant is it when one of the disapprovers appears
      with the girl whose selfish irresponsibility caused all the trouble. Sue's
      evident happiness was the climax. It seemed to Peter that she might at
      least have the decency to look&mdash;well, chastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke a moment back of other disturbances within Peter's highly
      temperamental breast. They had to do with the play. The featured actress,
      Grace Derring, also was potentially a disturber. If you have followed
      Peter's emotionally tortuous career, you will recall Grace. With his
      kisses warm on her lips, protesting her love for him, she had rewritten
      his play behind his back, tearing it to pieces, introducing new and quite
      false episodes, altering the very natures of his painstakingly wrought out
      characters, obliterating whatever of himself had, at the start, been in
      the piece. He had been forced to wash his hands of the whole thing. He had
      kept away from Neuerman and Grace Derring all these painful months. He had
      answered neither Neuerman's business letters nor Grace's one or two
      guarded little notes. It had perturbed turn to see his name used lavishly
      (Neuerman was a persistent and powerful advertiser) on the bill-boards and
      in the papers. It had perturbed him to-night to see it on the street in
      blazing light. And now it was on the program in his hand!... To be sure he
      had not taken steps to prevent this use of his name. He had explained to
      himself that Neuerman had the right under the contract and could hardly be
      restrained. But he was perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here was the great night! Down there on the stage, in a few minutes
      now, Grace Derring, whose life had twisted so painfully close to his,
      would begin enacting the play she and Neuerman had rebuilt from his own
      inspired outburst. Up here in the gallery, across the aisle, one row down,
      sat at this moment, the girl who had unwittingly inspired him to write it;
      She was smiling happily now, that girl. She did not know that the original
      play&mdash;<i>The Trufiler</i> as he had conceived and written it&mdash;was
      aimed straight at herself. It was nothing if not a picture of the
      irresponsible, selfish bachelor girl who by her insistence on &ldquo;living her
      own life&rdquo; wrecks the home of her parents. Peter's mouth set rather grimly
      as he thought of this now. As he saw it, Sue had done just that. Suddenly&mdash;he
      was looking from behind his hand at her shapely head; her hair had grown
      to an almost manageable length&mdash;a warm thought fluttered to life in
      his heart. Perhaps it wasn't, even yet, too late! Perhaps enough of his
      original message had survived the machinations of Neuerman and Grace
      Derring to strike through and touch this girl's heart&mdash;sober her&mdash;make
      her think! It might even work out that... he had to set his teeth hard on
      the thoughts that came rushing now. It was as if a door had opened,
      letting loose the old forces, the old dreams (that is, the particular lot
      that had concerned his relations with Sue) that he had thought dead, long
      since, of inanition.... Confused with all these dreams and hopes, these
      resentments and indignations, was a thought that had been thrusting itself
      upon him of late as he followed Neuerman's publicity. It was that the play
      might succeed. However bad Grace had made it, it might succeed. This would
      mean money, a little fame, a thrilling sense of position and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue glanced around. Her elbow gently pressed that of the Worm. &ldquo;It's
      Peter,&rdquo; she said low. &ldquo;He doesn't see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm glanced around now. They were both looking at Peter, rather
      eagerly, smiling. The eminent playwright gazed steadily off across the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks all in,&rdquo; observed the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Peter&rdquo;&mdash;this from Sue&mdash;&ldquo;these first nights are a frightful
      strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; the Worm called softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to see them now. He came across the aisle, shook hands, peered
      gloomily, self-consciously down at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiding?&rdquo; asked Sue, all smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's gloom deepened. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently you're not figuring on taking the author's call,&rdquo; said the
      Worm, surveying Peter's business suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The playwright raised his hand, moved it lightly as if tossing away an
      inconsiderable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? I'm not interested. It's not my play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was smiling. What was the matter with them&mdash;grinning like
      monkeys! Couldn't they at least show a decent respect for his feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a rather wide-spread notion to the contrary,&rdquo; said the Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&rdquo;&mdash;again that gesture from Peter&mdash;-&ldquo;my name is on it.
      But it is not my play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrugged. &ldquo;How should I know? Haven't been near them for five
      months. They were all rewriting it then. They never grasped it. Neuerman,
      to this day, I'm sure, has no idea what it is about. Can't say I'm eager
      to view the remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra struck up. Peter dropped back into his seat. He raised his
      program again, and again watched Sue from behind it. He had managed to
      keep up a calm front, but at considerable cost to his already racked
      nervous system. Sue's smile, her fresh olive skin, her extraordinary green
      eyes, the subtly pleasing poise of her head on her perfect neck, touched
      again a certain group of associated emotions that had slumbered of late.
      Surely she had not forgotten&mdash;-the few disturbed, thrilling days of
      their engagement&mdash;their first kiss, that had so surprised them both,
      up in his rooms....
    </p>
    <p>
      She couldn't have forgotten! Perhaps his mutilated message <i>might</i>
      touch and stir her. Perhaps again....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Peter's program fluttered to the aisle. He drew an envelope from
      one pocket, a pencil from another; stared a moment, openly, at her hair
      and the curve of her cheek; and wrote, furiously, a sonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed out, interlined, rephrased. It was a passionate enough little
      uprush of emotion, expressing very well what he felt on seeing again,
      after long absence, a woman he had loved&mdash;hearing her voice, looking
      at her hair and the shadows of it on her temple and cheek&mdash;remembering,
      suddenly, with a stab of pain, the old yearnings, torments and
      exaltations. Peter couldn't possibly have been so excited as he was
      to-night without writing some-thing. His emotions had to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights went down. The music was hushed. There was a moment of dim
      silence; then the curtain slowly rose. The sophisticated, sensation-hungry
      nine hundred settled back in their seats and dared the play to interest
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always thought that there was a touch of pure genius in the job
      Grace Derring did with <i>The Truffler</i>. Particularly in her rewriting
      of the principal part. On the side of acting, it was unquestionably the
      best thing she had done&mdash;perhaps the best she will ever do. The
      situation was odd, at the start. Peter&mdash;writing, preaching, shouting
      at Sue&mdash;-had let his personal irritation creep everywhere into the
      structure of the play. He was telling her what he thought she was&mdash;a
      truffler, a selfish girl, avoiding all of life's sober duties, interested
      only in the pursuit of dainties, experimenting with pleasurable emotions.
      He had written with heat and force; the structure of the piece was
      effective enough. The difficulty (which Grace had been quick to divine)
      was that he had made an unsympathetic character of his girl. The practical
      difficulty, I mean. I am not sure that the girl as Peter originally drew
      her was not a really brilliant bit of characterization. But on the
      American stage, as in the American novel, you must choose, always, between
      artistic honesty and &ldquo;sympathy.&rdquo; The part of commercial wisdom is to
      choose the latter. You may draw a harsh but noble character, a weak but
      likable character, you may picture cruelty and vice as a preliminary to
      Wesleyan conviction of sin and reformation; but never the unregenerate
      article. You may never be &ldquo;unpleasant.&rdquo; All this, of course, Peter knew.
      The adroit manipulating of sympathy was the thing, really, he did best.
      But when he wrote <i>The Truffler</i> he was too excited over Sue and too
      irritated to write anything but his real thoughts. Therefore the play had
      more power, more of freshness and the surface sense of life, than anything
      else he had written up to that time. And therefore it was commercially
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Grace Herring was a bachelor girl herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the life. She had foregone the traditional duties&mdash;marriage,
      home-building, motherhood&mdash;in order to express her own life and
      gifts. She had loved&mdash;unwisely, too well&mdash;Peter. Like Peter, she
      approached the play in a state of nerves. As a practical player she knew
      that the girl would never win her audience unless grounds could be found
      for the audience to like her despite her Nietzschean philosophy. What she
      perhaps saw less clearly was that in her conception of the part she had to
      frame an answer to Peter's charges. Probably, almost certainly, she
      supposed the play something of a personal attack on her own life.
      Therefore she added her view of the girl to Peter's, and played her as a
      counter attack. If it had been real in the writing to Peter, it was quite
      as real in the playing to Grace. The result of this conflict of two
      aroused emotional natures was a brilliant theatrical success. Though I am
      not sure that the play, in its final form, meant anything. I am not sure.
      It was rather a baffling thing. But it stirred you, and in the third act,
      made you cry. Everybody cried in the third act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain came slowly down on the first act. The lights came slowly up.
      A house that had been profoundly still, absorbed in the clean-cut
      presentment of apparently real people, stirred, rustled, got up, moved
      into the aisles, burst into talk that rapidly swelled into a low roar. The
      applause came a little late, almost as if it were an after-thought, and
      then ran wild. There were seven curtain calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down-stairs, two critics&mdash;blasé young men, wandered out into the
      lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Derring's good,&rdquo; observed one. &ldquo;This piece may land her solid on
      Broadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First act's all right,&rdquo; replied the other casually, lighting a cigarette.
      &ldquo;I didn't suppose Pete Mann could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up in the gallery, Sue, looking around, pressed suddenly close to the
      Worm, and whispered, &ldquo;Henry&mdash;quick! Look at Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The playwright stood before his aisle seat, staring with wild eyes up at
      the half-draped plaster ladies on the proscenium arch. A line of persons
      in his row were pressing toward the aisle. A young woman, next to him,
      touched his arm and said, &ldquo;Excuse me, please!&rdquo; Sue and the Worm heard her
      but not Peter. He continued to stare&mdash;a tall conspicuous man, in
      black-rimmed glasses, a black ribbon hanging from them down his long face.
      His hand raised to his chest, clutched what appeared to be an envelope,
      folded the long way. Plainly he was beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in the aisle saw him now and stared. There was whispering. Some
      one laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the young woman touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, saw that he was blocking the row, noted the eyes on him. became
      suddenly red, and stuffing the folded envelope into his pocket and seizing
      his hat, rapidly elbowed his way up the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately following this incident attention was shifted to another. A
      good-looking young woman, apparently an Italian, who had been sitting four
      rows behind Peter and oft to the left, was struggling, in some evident
      excitement, to get out and up the aisle. Her impetuosity made her as
      conspicuous as Peter had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue, still watching the crowd that had closed in behind the flying Peter,
      noted the fresh commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite an evening!&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;Seems to be a lady playwright in
      our midst, as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm regarded the new center of interest and grew thoughtful. He knew
      the girl. It was Maria Tonifetti, manicurist at the sanitary barber shop
      of Marius. He happened, too, to be aware that Peter knew Maria. He had
      seen Pete in there getting his nails done. Once, this past summer, he had
      observed them together on a Fifth Avenue bus. And on a Sunday evening he
      had met them face to face at Coney Island, and Peter had gone red and
      hurried by. Now he watched Maria slipping swiftly up the aisle, where
      Peter had disappeared only a moment before. He did not tell Sue that he
      knew who she was.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII&mdash;PETER STEALS A PLAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER rushed like a
      wild man down the stairs to the street. He looked up street and down for a
      cruising taxi; saw one at the opposite curb; dodged across, behind
      automobiles and in front of a street-car. A traffic policeman shouted from
      the corner. Peter was unaware, he dove into the taxi, shouting as he did
      so, the address of the rooms in Washington Square. The taxi whirled away
      to the south. Peter, a blaze of nerves, watched the dial, taking silver
      coins from his pocket as the charge mounted. At his door, he plunged out
      to the walk, threw the money on the driver's seat, dashed into the old
      bachelor apartment building. The rooms had been lonely of late without Hy
      and the Worm. Now, his mind on the one great purpose, he forgot that these
      friends had ever lived. He ran from the elevator to the apartment door,
      key in hand, hurried within and tore into the closet. He emerged with his
      evening clothes&mdash;the coat on the hanger, the trousers in the press&mdash;and
      his patent leather shoes. From a bureau drawer he produced white silk
      waistcoat (wrapped in tissue-paper) and dress shirt. A moment more and he
      was removing, hurriedly yet not without an eye for buttons and the crease
      in the trousers, his business suit. He did not forget to transfer the
      folded envelope to the inner pocket of his dress coat. But first he read
      the sonnet that was penciled on it; and reread it. It seemed to him
      astonishingly good. &ldquo;That's the way,&rdquo; he reflected, during the process,
      standing before the mirror, of knotting his white tie,&mdash;&ldquo;when your
      emotions are stirred to white heat, and an idea comes, write it down. No
      matter where you are, write it down. Then you've got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked thoughtfully at the long serious face that confronted him in the
      mirror, made longer by the ribbon that hung from his glasses. His hair was
      dark and thick, and it waved back from a high forehead. He straightened
      his shoulders, drew in his chin. That really distinguished young man,
      there in the mirror, was none other than Eric Mann, the playwright; author
      of the new Broadway success, <i>The Truffler</i>, a man of many gifts; a
      man, in short, of genius. Forgetting for the moment, his hurry, he drew
      the folded envelope from his pocket and read the sonnet aloud, with
      feeling and with gestures. In the intervals of glancing at the measured
      lines, he studied the poet before him. The spectacle thrilled him. Just as
      he meant that the poem should thrill the errant Sue when he should read it
      to her. He determined now that she should not see it until he could get
      her alone and read it aloud. Once before during this strange year of ups
      and downs, he had read a thing of his to Sue and had thrilled her as he
      was now thrilling himself. Right here in these rooms. He had swept her off
      her feet, had kissed her..Well... He smiled exultingly at the germs in the
      mirror. Then he had been a discouraged young playwright, beaten down by
      failure. How he was&mdash;or shortly would be&mdash;the sensation of
      Broadway, author of the enormously successful Nature film, and following
      up that triumph by picking to pieces the soul of the selfish &ldquo;modern&rdquo;
       bachelor girl&mdash;picking it to pieces so deftly, with such unerring
      theatrical instinct, that even the bachelor girl herself would have to
      join the throngs that would be crowding into the theater to see how
      supremely well he did it. More, was he not minting a new word, a needed
      word, to describe the creature. &ldquo;The Truffler&rdquo;&mdash;truffling&mdash;to
      truffle!
    </p>
    <p>
      A grand word; it perfectly hit off the sort of thing. Within ten years it
      would be in the dictionaries; and he, Peter Ericson Mann, would have put
      it there. He must jog Neuerman up about this. To-morrow. Neuerman must see
      to it that the word did get into the language. No time to lose. A
      publicity job!... Come to think of it he didn't even know who was doing
      the publicity for Neuerman now. He must look into that. To-morrow. Shrewd,
      hard-hitting publicity work is everything. That's what lands you. Puts
      your name in among the household treasures. People take you for granted;
      assume your greatness without exactly knowing why you are great. Then
      you're entrenched. Then you're famous. No matter if you do bad work. They
      don't know the difference. You're famous, that's all there is to it. They
      have to take you, talk about you, buy your books, go to your plays. Mere
      merit hasn't a chance against you. You smash 'em every time... fame&mdash;money&mdash;power!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the simply-clad Sue Wilde; short hair all massed shadows and
      shining high lights; olive skin with rose in it; the figure of a boy; all
      lightness, ease, grace; those stirring green eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      He would read to her again. His sonnet! From the heart&mdash;glowing with
      the fire that even in his triumph he could not forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The third was the &ldquo;big act&rdquo;; (there were four in all). All was ready for
      the artificial triumph that was to follow it&mdash;trained ushers, ticket
      sellers, door man, behind the last row of orchestra seats, clapping like
      mad. Experienced friends of the management in groups where they could do
      the most good. Trick curtains, each suggesting, by grouping or movement on
      the stage, the next. Neuerman wanted eight curtains after the big act. He
      got them&mdash;and five more. For the claques were overwhelmed. A
      sophisticated audience that had forgotten for once how to be cold-blooded,
      tears drying unheeded on grizzled cheeks, was on its feet, clapping,
      stamping, shouting. After the third curtain came the first shouts for
      &ldquo;Author.&rdquo; The shouts grew into an insistent roar. Again and again the
      curtain rose on the shifting, carefully devised group effects; the
      audience had been stirred, and it wanted the man whose genius had stirred
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind, in the prompt corner, there was some confusion. You couldn't tell
      that excited mob that Peter Mann hadn't written fifty lines of that
      cumulatively moving story. It was his play, by contract. The credit was
      his; and the money. But no one had seen him for months.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the tenth call Neuerman ordered the footlights down and the
      house-lights up. He wore part of a wrinkled business suit; his collar was
      a rag; his waistcoat partly unbuttoned. He didn't know where he had thrown
      his coat. The sweat rolled in rivulets down his fat face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out front the roar grew louder. Neuerman ordered the house-lights down
      again and the footlights up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Grace,&rdquo; he said, to Miss Herring who stood, in the shirt-waist and
      short skirt of the part, looking very girlish and utterly dazed&mdash;&ldquo;for
      God's sake take the author's call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;You take it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I couldn't say a word&mdash;not
      if it was for my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me take it!&rdquo; He was mimicking her, from sheer nervousness. &ldquo;<i>Me</i>
      take it? In these clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little at this, absently. Flowers had come to her&mdash;great
      heaps of them. She snatched up an armful of long-stemmed roses; buried her
      face in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuerman waved the curtain up again; took her arm, made her go on. She
      bowed again, out there, hugging her roses, an excited light in her eyes;
      and once more backed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, <i>say</i> something!&rdquo; cried the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored this; bent over and looked through the heaps of flowers for a
      certain card. It was not there. She pouted&mdash;not like her rather
      experienced self but like the girl she was playing&mdash;and hugged the
      roses again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the twelfth time the curtain rose. Again she could only bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuerman mopped his forehead; then wrung out his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody say something,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Ardrey could do it.&rdquo; (Ardrey was the
      leading man.) &ldquo;Where's Ardrey? Here you&mdash;call Mr. Ardrey! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the call,&rdquo; said a quiet voice at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuerman gave the newcomer a look of intense relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Derring caught her breath, reached for a scene-support to steady
      herself; murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain slid swiftly up. And Peter Ericson Mann, looking really
      distinguished in his evening clothes, with the big glasses and the heavy
      black ribbon, very grave, walked deliberately out front, faced the
      footlights and the indistinct sea of faces, and unsmiling, waited for the
      uproar that greeted him to die down. He waited&mdash;it was almost painful&mdash;until
      the house was still..
    </p>
    <p>
      Up in the gallery, Sue Wilde, leaning forward, her chin propped on her two
      small fists, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That beats anything I ever....&rdquo; She ended with a slow smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worm was studying the erect dignified figure down there on the stage.
      &ldquo;You've got to hand it to Pete,&rdquo; said he musingly. &ldquo;He sensed it in the
      first act. He saw it was going to be a knock-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Sue, &ldquo;he decided, after all, that it was his play. Henry, I'm
      not sure that he isn't the most irritating man on the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's that, all right, Sue, child; but I'm not sure that he isn't a
      genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they are like that,&rdquo; said Sue, thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egotists, of course, looking at everything with a squint&mdash;all off
      balance! Take Pete's own heroes, Cellini, Wagner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, slipping her hand into his, twisting her slim fingers
      among his&mdash;&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter began speaking. His voice was well placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could hear every syllable. And he looked straight up at Sue. She noted
      this, and pressed closer to the man at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an unfashionable play (thus Peter). If you like it, I am of
      course deeply pleased. I did not write it to please you. It is a
      preachment. For some years I have quietly observed the modern young woman,
      the more or less self-supporting bachelor girl, the girl who places her
      independence, her capricious freedom, her 'rights' above all those
      functions and duties to others on which woman's traditional quality, her
      finest quality, must rest. She is not interested in marriage, this
      bachelor girl, because she will surrender no item in her program of self
      indulgence. She is not interested in motherhood, because that implies
      self-abnegation. She talks economic independence while profiting by her
      sex-attraction. She uses men by disturbing them, confusing them; and thus
      shrewdly makes her own way. She plays with life, producing nothing. She
      builds no home, she rears no young. She talks glibly the selfish
      philosophy of Nietzsche, of Artzibasheff. She bases her self-justifying
      faith on the hideous animalism of Freud. She asserts her right, as she
      says, to give love, not to sell it in what she terms the property
      marriage. She speaks casually of 'the free relation' in love. She will not
      use the phrase 'free love'; but that, of course, is what she means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nation can become better that the quality of its womanhood, of its
      motherhood. No nation without an ideal, a standard of nobility, can
      endure. We have come upon the days, these devastating days of war, when
      each nation is put to the test. Each nation must now exhibit its quality
      or die. This quality, in the last analysis, is capacity for sacrifice. It
      is endurance, and self-abnegation in the interest of all. It is surrender&mdash;the
      surrender to principle, order, duty, without which there can be no
      victory. The woman, like the man, who will not live for her country may
      yet be forced to die for her country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The educated young woman of to-day, the bachelor girl, the 'modern' girl,
      will speak loudly of her right to vote, her right to express herself,&mdash;that
      is her great phrase, 'self-expression'!&mdash;her intellectual superiority
      to marriage and motherhood. She will insist on what she calls freedom. For
      that she will even become militant. These phrases, and the not very
      pleasant life they cover, mean sterility, they mean anarchism, they mean
      disorganization, and perhaps death. They are the doctrine of the truffler,
      the woman who turns from duty to a passionate pursuit of enjoyment. They
      are eating, those phrases, like foul bacteria, at the once sound heart of
      our national life.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see, in presenting this little picture of a girl who thought
      freedom&mdash;for herself&mdash;was everything, and of the havoc she
      wrought in one perhaps representative home, I have not been trying to
      entertain you. I have been preaching at you. If, inadvertently, I have
      entertained you as well, so much the better. For then my little sermon
      will have a wider audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, deliberately, he walked off stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the stairs, moving slowly down from the gallery, Sue and the Worm
      looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm rather bewildered,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Nobody knew the play was about all that. But they believe him. Hear
      them yelling in there. He has put it over. Pete is a serious artist now.
      He admits it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was rather a personal animus in the speech. Didn't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. He was talking straight at you. Back last spring I gathered that
      he was writing the play at you&mdash;his original version of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From one landing to another Sue was silent. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew such a contradictory man. Why, he wrote the Nature film. And
      that is all for freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Worm smiled. &ldquo;Pete never had an idea in his life. He soaks up
      atmospheres and then, because he <i>is</i> a playwright and a dam' good
      one, he turns them into plays. He sees nothing but effects. Pete can't <i>think!</i>
      And then, of course, he sees the main chance. He never misses that. Why,
      that speech was pure genius. Gives 'em a chance to believe that the stuff
      they love because it's amusing and makes 'em blubber is really serious and
      important. Once you can make 'em believe that, you're made. Pete is made,
      right now. He's a whale of a success. He's going to be rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Henry, they'll see through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;she was laughing a little&mdash;&ldquo;it's outrageous.
      Here are two successes&mdash;right here on Broadway&mdash;both by Peter&mdash;each
      a preachment and each flatly contradicting the other. Do you mean to say
      that somebody won't point it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if somebody does? Who'd care? The public can't think either, you
      see. They're like Pete, all they can see is effects. And, of course, the
      main chance. They love his effectiveness. And they admire him for
      succeeding. I'm not sure, myself, that he isn't on the way to becoming
      what they call a great man.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX&mdash;A MOMENT OF MELODRAMA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> HEY wandered into
      the crowded lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friends were there from Greenwich Village. There was a high buzz of
      excitement. Jaded critics were smiling with pleasure; it was a relief, now
      and then, to be spared boredom. Peter had spared them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter himself appeared, wearing his high hat&mdash;flushed, his eyes
      blazing, but unsmiling. He held a folded envelope against his shirt-front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acquaintances caught at him as he passed. One critic publicly
      congratulated him. It was an ovation; or it would have been had he
      responded. But he saw, out near the entrance, through the crowd, the face
      of Sue Wilde. He pressed through to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sue,&rdquo; he murmured in her ear. &ldquo;I want to see you? How about to-morrow?
      Lunch with me perhaps? I've written something....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excited eyes wandered down to the paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue, smiling a little, suddenly rather excited herself, pulled at the
      Worm's elbow. That young man turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be across, Pete,&rdquo; he said casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter glared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the words he might have uttered, by way of putting this too casual old
      friend in his place, remained unsaid. For Sue, demure of everything
      excepting eyes, remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband, Peter. We were married to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The playwright dropped, in one instant, from the pinnacle of fame, money
      power, on which, for nearly two hours, he had been exultingly poised. His
      chin sagged. His eyes were dazed. A white pinched expression came over his
      long face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married&mdash;to-day!&rdquo; He repeated the words in a flat voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;You must congratulate us, Peter. We're dreadfully happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter seemed unable, however, to say anything more. He continued to stare.
      The beginnings of a low laugh of sheer delight bubbled upward within Sue's
      radiant being. Peter heard it, or felt it. Suddenly he bolted&mdash;out
      through the crowd to the sidewalk. He brushed aside the enthusiastic hands
      that would detain him. He disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are conflicting reports as to what occurred after this. <i>The
      Evening Earth</i> described the incident as taking place on the sidewalk
      directly in front of the theater. <i>The Press-Record</i> had it on the
      farther corner, across the side street. <i>The Morning Bulletin</i> and <i>The
      Continental</i> agreed that the woman pursued him through the stage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside there, the traffic was heavy. Street-cars and motors filled the
      street from curb to curb. Women and their escorts were passing out of and
      into the famous restaurant that is next door but one to the Astoria. The
      sidewalk was crowded as always in the theater district on a fine September
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacMerry, dramatic critic of <i>The Standard</i>, was the one closest to
      it. He had stepped outside to smoke his cigarette, found himself at the
      playwright's elbow, and spoke pleasantly to him of the play. He noted at
      the time, as he explained later at his club, that Mann was oblivious. He
      was very pale, stared straight ahead, and appeared to be drifting with the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage entrance to the Astoria is not around the corner, but is a
      narrow passage leading back from the street on the farther side of the
      restaurant. It was at this point, said MacMerry, that Mann came to a stop.
      He seemed dazed. Which was not unnatural, considering the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, a young woman rushed forward. She was of an Italian
      cast of countenance, not bad-looking, but evidently in a state of extreme
      excitement. Apparently she had been standing close to the building,
      watching the crowd. She had a knife in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This knife she wielded on the playwright. Three or four separate times she
      stabbed at his chest, evidently striking for the heart. Trying to seize
      her hand, Mann received a slight cut on the fingers. MacMerry himself
      finally caught her forearm, threw her back against the building, and took
      the knife away from her. By this time, of course, a dense crowd had
      pressed about them. And Mann, without a word, had slipped into the passage
      leading to the stage. Certainly, when the policeman got through to the
      critic's side, Mann was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked it over in the lobby. There the Worm, catching an inkling of
      the catastrophe, took a hand. Learning from MacMerry that the girl was
      evidently an Italian, he put forth the theory that she had probably
      mistaken Pete for a man of her own blood. Peter was dark of hair and skin.
      Considering this, MacMerry recalled that Peter had given no sign of
      knowing the woman. And he could not recall that she had spoken his name.
      He and the Worm then talked this over with the newspaper men that came
      rushing to the scene. The theory-found its acceptors. The Worm pointed out
      that Peter was a man of quiet manners and of considerable dignity. He was
      never a roysterer. His ideas were serious. It was not likely that the
      woman had any claim upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the strongest influence working in Peter's interest was the fact
      that he was actually, at the moment, bursting into a big success. Every
      one, newspaper workers among the others, was glad to help him along. It
      was the thing to do. So by midnight all had agreed that it was a case of
      mistaken identity. Peter's luck held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime a little drama more real than any Peter had yet been credited
      with writing was taking place behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Act four was short; and from curtain to curtain Miss Derring held the
      stage. Therefore she had no knowledge of what was taking place in her
      dressing-room. Whether Peter came back with any coherent intention of
      finding Grace. I can not say. It is not likely. The most intensely
      exciting evening of his life had reached its climax in a short scene in
      which a young woman had stabbed him. Immediately preceding this event, he
      had encountered the astounding fact that the girl it seemed to him he had
      always loved more than any one else in the world was married&mdash;married
      to his old chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ran through the dark passage from the street to the stage door, his
      hand still clutched the paper on which he had written the sonnet that was
      to touch her heart. You are to remember that this bit of verse had
      considerable emotional quality and more than a touch of grace. He had
      written it on an old envelope, seated in a crowded theater; but then,
      Schubert wrote wonderful songs on restaurant menus. It is so that things
      are done in the world of temperament.... I don't believe he knew what he
      was doing, then or later; perhaps, until the next morning. If Peter ever
      knew what he was doing!
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was already up when he slipped sidewise past the doorman,
      through the vestibule, on to the stage. It was dim and still back there.
      Far away, beyond the great shadowy cluster of canvas and wood structures
      that made up the fourth act set, he could hear Grace's voice. Down front,
      by the prompt corner stood a silent little group&mdash;four or five
      actors, the electrician, the mighty Max Neuerman in his shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scene flats, six deep, were propped against the wall. He had to pick his
      way between piled-up properties and furniture. Two stage hands moved aside
      and let him by. He was conscious of feeling weak. His head was a maelstrom
      of whirling emotions. He was frightened. He couldn't get his breath. It
      wouldn't do to stay around here&mdash;perhaps make a scene and spoil his
      own play. He had no means of knowing for certain that Maria had not
      escaped MacMerry and pursued him up the passage. What if she should
      overpower the doorman&mdash;a superannuated actor&mdash;and get at him
      again! Even if she shouldn't, he might faint, or die. It was curiously
      hard to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt his way past more scenery, more properties. There was a doorway in
      the concrete stage wall, leading to dressing-rooms on a corridor, and more
      dressing-rooms up a twisting iron stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace would have the star's room, of course. She wasn't a star yet, but
      Neuerman was featuring her name in all the advertising. That would
      naturally entitle her to the star's room. That would be the end room with
      the outside light. The door was ajar. It was a large room. Yes, he could
      see her first act frock, over a chair. And Minna, the maid who had been
      with her when&mdash;when he and she had been on rather good terms, very
      good terms&mdash;was sitting quietly by the dresser, sewing. Minna was a
      discreet little person. She had carried notes and things. Still, it was
      awkward. He would prefer not having Minna see him just now.... He <i>was</i>
      weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it necessary to catch at the iron stair rail and steady
      himself... Grace, you had to admit, was a good deal of a girl. It was
      rather remarkable, considering her hard life, the work, the travel, the&mdash;well,
      the one or two experiences&mdash;how fresh she looked, how young, how full
      of magnetic charm. Why, Grace was twenty-eight if she was a day! But she
      was putting the play over in great style. You had to admire her for that.
      It was too bad, thinking it all ever, that their relations hadn't gone
      quietly along on a friendly basis, that emotions should have torn her so,
      intensifying her demands on him, making it really necessary for him to
      break off with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged into the dressing-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL&mdash;HIS UNCONQUERABLE SOUL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE maid, Minna,
      sprang up, dropping her sewing and giving a throaty little shriek. Peter,
      steadying himself with an effort, softly closed the doer, leaned back
      against it, and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't scream like that! They'll hear you clear to
      Fiftieth Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had staggered back against the wall, was supporting herself there
      with outspread hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mann&mdash;you frightened me! And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes wandered
      from his white face to his shirt-front. That had been white. It was now
      spotted red with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared down at it, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Mr. Mann, will you lie down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to clear a heap of garments off the sofa: then she took his
      arm and steadied him as he walked across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't let me call a doctor, Mr. Mann?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Don't call anybody! Keep your head shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, help me with these studs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better take your coat off first, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She helped him get it off; unbuttoned his waistcoat; untied his white bow.
      He had to unbutton the collar himself, holding all the while to his folded
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's astonishing how weak I am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Mann, you're bleeding to death!&rdquo; The girl began weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not bleeding to death! That's nonsense! Don't you talk like that to
      me&mdash;keep your head shut! It's nothing at all. I'll be all right. Just
      a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Mann&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter glanced nervously toward the door. &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he whispered huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got the studs out of his shirt, and opened it. Beneath, his singlet
      was dripping red. She drew in a spasmodic long breath, with a whistling
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, for God's sake, don't you go and faint!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I tell you it's
      nothing&mdash;nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was crying now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit your blubbering! Quit it!... Here!&rdquo;&mdash;he reached painfully into
      his pocket, produced a bank note&mdash;&ldquo;run over to the drug store&mdash;there's
      one just across, on the corner&mdash;and get some things&mdash;bandages,
      cotton, something to wash it off with. And hurry! I've got to be out of
      here in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't let me call a doctor, Mr. Mann?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call nothing! You do as I tell you. Understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the money and slipped out, carefully closing the door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, flat on the sofa, peered about him. He wished the room were less
      brightly lighted. And it was disagreeably full of flowers. The air was
      heavy with the scent of them&mdash;like a funeral. Doubtless it would have
      been the decent thing for him to have sent Grace a few roses. If only for
      old times' sake. The window shade was swaying in the soft September breeze&mdash;what
      if Marla should be out there in the alley, peeping in? The sweat burst out
      on his forehead. <i>Had</i> they held her? God&mdash;if they hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze drooped to the painful spectacle of his own person. He was a
      sight. There was blood all over his hands now, and on his clothes. The
      paper he gripped was stained with it. It had got on the sofa. It was on
      the floor. The door-knob, the door itself, the wall beside it, were marked
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if Grace should come in! What could he say? Could he say anything?
      His mind darted about this way and that, like a rat in a trap. This was
      awful! Where was that girl? Why, in Heaven's name, didn't she come hack?
      It seemed to him that hours were passing. He observed that the blood came
      faster when he moved, and he lay very still.... Hours&mdash;hours&mdash;hours!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds outside. Some one ran up the iron stairs. Then some one
      else. People were speaking. The act&mdash;the play&mdash;was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself on his elbow. There was another step in the corridor, a
      step he knew. He let himself slowly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door swung open. Grace, tired, a far-away look in her eyes, was coming
      slowly in. Then she fairly sprang in&mdash;and closed the door sharply.
      She was across the room before he could collect his thoughts and on her
      knees, her arms about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Grace. You'll get all covered with this stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, wide, horror-struck, were fastened on his. &ldquo;Peter&mdash;how
      awful! What is it? What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her solicitude was unexpectedly soothing. His self-respect came creeping
      back, a thought shamefaced. He even smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Grace, dear. Something happened&mdash;out in the street. A
      fight, I think. I was walking by. Then I was stabbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;some dreadful mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it silly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have Neuerman get Doctor Brimmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;please&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she rushed out. In a moment she was back, with an armful of parcels.
      &ldquo;Poor Minna&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent her to the drug store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She fainted. She was bringing these things. They've carried her into
      Miss Dunson's room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her. He had forgotten that she was so pretty, that she had so
      much personality even off-stage. The turbulence in his heart seemed all at
      once to be dying down. A little glow was setting up there now. The little
      glow was growing. There was, after all, a great deal between him and
      Grace. He had treated her shabbily, o: course. He hadn't known how to
      avoid that, She was a dear to be so sweet about it.... The way she had
      rushed to him, the feel of her firm smooth hand on his cheek, the fact
      that she had, right now, in the very moment of her triumph, forgotten
      herself utterly&mdash;that was rather wonderful. A fine girl, Grace!
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to him again; opened his singlet and examined the wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they're very deep,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What a strange experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're nothing,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better not do anything until the doctor comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending close over him. A loose strand of her fine hair brushed
      his cheek. A new fever was at work within him. He kissed her hair. She
      heard the sound but said nothing; she was washing away the blood with the
      antiseptic solution Minna had got. He caught one glimpse of her eyes; they
      were wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he knew that the sonnet, on the envelope, blood-soaked, was
      burning in his hand. He raised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful, dear!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Don't move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've quarreled, Grace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been&mdash;decent, even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I saw you to-night&mdash;&rdquo; He unfolded the envelope. &ldquo;I wrote
      this to-night. Up in the gallery...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, in a low voice that trembled with passion, he read it to her. And
      he saw the tears crowd out and slowly fall. He had his effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace, dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm tired of being alone&mdash;tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't we try the real thing&mdash;go all the way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;marriage. Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean marriage, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very tired, very thoughtful, still in the costume and make-up of the part,
      kneeling there beside him, she considered this. Finally she lifted her
      eyes to his. &ldquo;I'm willing, Peter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I won't try to deceive
      myself. It is what I have wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came then; bandaged him, and advised quiet for a few days,
      preferably in a hospital. When he had gone, she cried with a half smile:
      &ldquo;You're not going to his old hospital, Peter. You're coming home with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay there in a beatific dream while she changed to her street clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were ready to go. She had ordered an ambulance, and they were
      waiting. There was a knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. First to appear was a breezy young man who could not
      possibly have been other than a press-agent&mdash;a very happy
      press-agent. Next came a policeman; a mounted policeman, evidently, from
      his natty white cap and his puttees. Following were half a dozen newspaper
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Mann,&rdquo; said the press-agent, &ldquo;but they're
      holding the woman, and the officer wants to know if you're going to prefer
      charges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to prefer charges against anybody,&rdquo; said Peter with quiet
      dignity. And then added: &ldquo;What woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman looked straight at him. &ldquo;The young woman that stabbed you,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter made a weak gesture. His dignity was impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know yet what it was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It happened so quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The press-agent gave the officer a triumphant look, as if to say: &ldquo;There,
      you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you could identify her?&rdquo; This from the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I'm afraid I couldn't. My thoughts were anywhere but
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away then. The reporters hung eagerly on the sill, but the
      press-agent hustled them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace, subdued, thinking hard, took her hat from the wall rack. A woman
      had stabbed him. Grace knew, none better, that her Peter was an extremely
      subtle and plausible young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had wanted him. She had got him. And she let it go at that. In the
      ambulance, all the way to her rooms, her arm was under his head, her smile
      was instant when his roving gaze sought her face. It seemed to her that he
      was grateful, that he wanted her there. This was something. And the poor
      boy was suffering!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he spoke. He was very weak. And there was noise in the street. She
      had to bend close to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That press-agent&mdash;I should have talked with him&mdash;something very
      important....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sue and her new husband rode down to Washington Square on the bus, and
      wandered over into Greenwich Village. It was midnight. There were few
      signs of life along the twisted streets and about the little triangular
      parks. But Jim's was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had Welsh rabbits and coffee. The Worm lighted his caked old brier
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been thinking over Pete's speech, Susan,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. So have I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I recall it, the gist of it&rdquo;&mdash;the Worm's lean face bore the
      quizzically thoughtful expression that she loved to see there; she watched
      it now&mdash;&ldquo;Pete uses the word 'truffler' to mean a young woman who
      turns from duty to the pursuit of enjoyment. Those were pretty nearly his
      words, weren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Truffler, according to Pete, builds no home, rears no young, produces
      nothing. She goes in for self-expression instead of self-abnegation. She
      is out for herself, hunting the truffles, the delicate bits, playing with
      love and with life. That's about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in applying it only to women, Pete was arbitrary. For he was not
      defining a feminine quality&mdash;he was defining a human quality, surely
      more commonly found among members of his own sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;he clamped his lips around his pipe stem, puffed and grinned&mdash;&ldquo;no,
      Pete has done a funny thing, a very funny thing. The exasperating part of
      it is that he will never know. Do you get me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Pete's the original George W. Dogberry. He has described
      himself. That little analysis is a picture of his own life these past
      years. Could anything illustrate it more perfectly than the way he stole
      that play to-night? Self-interest? Self-expression? That's Pete. Hunting
      the delicate bits?&rdquo; He checked himself; he had not told Sue about Maria
      Tonifetti. He didn't propose to tell her. &ldquo;When has <i>he</i> built a
      home? When has <i>he</i> reared any young? When has <i>he</i> failed to
      assert his Nictzschean ego? When has <i>he</i> failed to yield to the
      Freudian wish? Who, I wonder, has free-loved more widely. Why, not Hy Lowe
      himself. And poor Hy is a chastened soul now. Betty's got him smothered,
      going to marry him after the divorce&mdash;if he has a job then. Waters
      Coryell told me.... No&rdquo;&mdash;he removed his pipe and blew a meditative
      ring of smoke&mdash;&ldquo;no, dear little girl, whatever the pestiferous Pete
      may think, or think he thinks, you are not the Truffler. Not you! No, the
      Truffler is Peter Ericson Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They wandered heme at one o'clock&mdash;home to the dingy little apartment
      on Tenth Street that had been her rooms and later his rooms. It was their
      rooms now. And the old quarters were not dingy, or bare or wanting in
      outlook, to the two young persons who let themselves in and stood
      silently, breathlessly there, she pressing close to his side; they were a
      gulden palace, brushed by wings of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she whispered, her arms about his neck, her wet face on his
      breast, her heart beating tumultuously against his&mdash;&ldquo;Henry, I want us
      to build a home, to&mdash;to produce...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With awe and a prayer in his heart, he kissed her.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
